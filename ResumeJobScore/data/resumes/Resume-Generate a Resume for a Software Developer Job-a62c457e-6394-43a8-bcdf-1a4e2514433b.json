development of a web based Dig Permit Work Order and Environmental Management System using ASPNET MVCBootstrapLeafletArcGIS Server Stack Developed a predictive model for prehistoric site location analysis for the Cultural Resource directive at YPG using geostatistics and ESRIs Spatial Analyst Also developed datasets tools and routines for Microsoft Silverlight based GIS Viewer and NET NITK ESRI ArcGIS Server web implementation using C and Javascript with Telerik based tools within Visual Studio Ft Sill Oklahoma 2014 Developed datasets and tools for NET NITK ESRI ArcGIS Server The existing application was updated to 1005 ArcGIS Server from the 9x series and 10x series and also uses the Telerik toolkit US Army Reserve Data Conversion 2014 Developed multiple toolstoolboxes with PythonModelbuilder ArcCatalog based interfaces with ArcGIS 10x for the mass data collection effort The automation tools were used for the collection of PRISMS based GIS data for over 250 Army Reserve sites Anniston Army Depot 2013 implemented a Silverlight API for ArcGIS Server application for Facility Management and Dig Permitting System The system communicates via Maximo with integrated facilities data linked to GIS assets South Florida Water Management District 201112 team of 3 developers for SilverlightASPNET ArcGIS Server with Oracle 10g httpcerpmap1cerpzoneorgarcgisappscerpmmsmmsviewer Redstone Arsenal 2013 created an automated mapping system for ingesting field data in custom forms in Microsoft Infopath XML based format linked the data to GPS surveys The maps were dynamically updated and delivered to the DPW GIS GIS ManagerProgrammer AGT Stennis Space Center MS April 2005 to May 2010 Worked as the GIS Manager for the Environmental Group for Center Operations at SSC I managed 3 GIS Analysts during Hurricane Katrina recovery and the GISbased Future Facility Master Planning at SSC for NASA HQ Manager As part of the Environmental Group at SSC performed duties in response to Hurricane Katrina developed portions of the NASA AgencyWide Environmental GIS website and helped update and automate the collection of information for SSC Natural Resource Management and Site Facilities GIS Installed ESRIs ArcIMS and ArcGIS Server software and developed websites to display geospatial information CERCLA Chemical Plume Modeling Installed managed developed the GIS database for the spatial plume modeling of volatile organic compounds VOCs throughout multiple water bearing zones at multiple sites Configured ArcSDE 91 with SQL Server 200005 with the onsite chemical labs RLIMS Chemical database Multilevel contamination plumes were modeled and evaluated from monitored wells chemical data With dynamic data the map products were automated and the process was displayed at the ESRI 2008 Users Conference the 2008 NASA Environmental Conference QAQC of geospatial data for Harris Corporation at Philadelphia MS Using ArcGIS PLTS tools and VBA wrote automation tools scripts and GUIs for QAQC tools for the production of TLM50 maps of North Korea for DOD GIS ProgrammerAnalyst Michael Baker Jr Inc Calgary AB March 1999 to April 2005 Natural Gas Pipeline Design routed from Vegreville Alberta to Chicago Illinois Aerial photography along with video was gathered and the photography was converted into Lizardtechs Mr Sid format for the ArcSDE database From the information gathered a route selection was chosen due to varying engineering factors wetlands road crossings existing structures water crossings foreign pipelines etc Any anomalies were collected and researched via fieldwork using GPS In addition quick maps were made in an attempt to avoid destroying drain tiles a costly problem in building an earlier semiparallel pipeline Alliance Environmental and construction alignment sheets were generated for the clients that included Canadian and American wetland information proposed workspaces temporary workspaces for construction and management The data was then incorporated into a database for future facility management Natural Gas Pipeline GIS for State of Alaska included initial assimilation of multiple competing pipeline ROWs for potential path from Prudhoe Bay to Point MacKenzie httpwwwagdcus CADDGIS Technology Center US Army Corp of Engineers Vicksburg District Wrote customized programs in AML to create a conversion from optional Data Line Graphs DLGs into the attribution of the TriService Spatial Data Standard for ARCINFO and ArcView currently known as SDSFIE Nashville Metro Water Services Developed scripts and procedures for the conversion of rastervector information of existing watersewerwastewater maps into ArcInfo format The Hansen model information was stripped from existing flatfile format and translated The area was digitized by Michael Baker Jr Incs Mexico City office using AutoCad and the QAQC programmatically checked for inconsistencies and exported datasets back into ArcInfo with a series of scripts Education MBA in ManagementFinance UAH Huntsville AL 2013 to 2015 University of Southern Mississippi Hattiesburg MS 1996 to 1998 BS in ChemistryMathematics
