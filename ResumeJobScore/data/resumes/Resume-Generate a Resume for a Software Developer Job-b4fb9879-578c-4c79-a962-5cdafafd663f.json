at Atlanta Delta office Description This project is mainly to refactor the existing Airport check in application known as SNAPP Single Network Application which is DELTAS HIGH Critical Application It is a SOAP based legacy application which needs to be migrated to RESTFUL application using REST web services spring boot and deploy on a cloud based CICD pipeline in an agile environment The legacy application working in the DELTA internal servers here we have proposed many changes to the frontend application without changing the legacy applications functionality We have proposed various solutions for it to a complete application so that therell be high availability and low cost Responsibilities Responsible for Scaled Agile Framework Methodology implementation and practices Used version one as ticketing systems We used Restful web service to re write the existing legacy application which is in SOAP Used Spring Actuator for health monitoring of the application Implemented functionalities using Spring IO Spring Boot with Hibernate ORM Used SOAP UI Postman Spring Mock MVC Spring 4Junit for testing the web services Testing the existing legacy application response using SOAP UI and designing new RESTFUL APIs to achieve new response with same functionality Make SOA calls to the legacy to access data for the refactored web services Implemented core java concepts like OOPS multithreading Collections and exception handling All the API end points follow a spring MVC architecture and I have applied concepts of spring framework like dependency injection etc Various modules of spring such as Spring Boot Spring MVC Spring core and Spring AOP etc Worked on MySQL database knowledge on writing CRUD queries and joint queries Followed Test Driven Development as well written JUnit test cases using JUnit and Mockito frameworks Created Swagger documents used YAML files to define API contracts Performed Swagger validation using validator tool to avoid errors in Swagger contracts Used Lombok Project in spring to avoid boiler plate code Since this is a TDD and CICD I have written Junit tests using Junit and Mockito frameworks Worked with version control system GitLab to manage the code repository Implemented Git merging and branching strategies to do user isolation and as well as feature isolation at branch level for easy rollbacks We are currently doing a major data migration as a part of the current project Good experience in solving SonarQube issues in order to maintain proper code quality Used sonar lint plugin for this Conduct Code reviews for other developers code every day whenever theres a Merge Request and suggested changes Migrated monolithic application to micro service architecture in order to increase the performance of the

at Atlanta Delta office Description This project is mainly to refactor the existing Airport check in application known as SNAPP Single Network Application which is DELTAS HIGH Critical Application It is a SOAP based legacy application which needs to be migrated to RESTFUL application using REST web services spring boot and deploy on a cloud based CICD pipeline in an agile environment The legacy application working in the DELTA internal servers here we have proposed many changes to the frontend application without changing the legacy applications functionality We have proposed various solutions for it to a complete application so that therell be high availability and low cost Responsibilities Responsible for Scaled Agile Framework Methodology implementation and practices Used version one as ticketing systems We used Restful web service to re write the existing legacy application which is in SOAP Used Spring Actuator for health monitoring of the application Implemented functionalities using Spring IO Spring Boot with Hibernate ORM Used SOAP UI Postman Spring Mock MVC Spring 4Junit for testing the web services Testing the existing legacy application response using SOAP UI and designing new RESTFUL APIs to achieve new response with same functionality Make SOA calls to the legacy to access data for the refactored web services Implemented core java concepts like OOPS multithreading Collections and exception handling All the API end points follow a spring MVC architecture and I have applied concepts of spring framework like dependency injection etc Various modules of spring such as Spring Boot Spring MVC Spring core and Spring AOP etc Worked on MySQL database knowledge on writing CRUD queries and joint queries Followed Test Driven Development as well written JUnit test cases using JUnit and Mockito frameworks Created Swagger documents used YAML files to define API contracts Performed Swagger validation using validator tool to avoid errors in Swagger contracts Used Lombok Project in spring to avoid boiler plate code Since this is a TDD and CICD I have written Junit tests using Junit and Mockito frameworks Worked with version control system GitLab to manage the code repository Implemented Git merging and branching strategies to do user isolation and as well as feature isolation at branch level for easy rollbacks We are currently doing a major data migration as a part of the current project Good experience in solving SonarQube issues in order to maintain proper code quality Used sonar lint plugin for this Conduct Code reviews for other developers code every day whenever theres a Merge Request and suggested changes Migrated monolithic application to micro service architecture in order to increase the performance of the application Used java 8 streams lambdas and other functional programming concepts in order to implement good coding standards Knowledge on integrating APIs with front end angular6 application Used
