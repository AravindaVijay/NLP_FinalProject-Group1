Dental Insurance Company ESP Extensions Group Responsible for rulebased extension implementation and Deltas claim application Programming in JavaGUI CApplication Cbase rule Oracle SQL on Unix platform Following Agile methodology Senior Software Engineer Altran Gurgaon Haryana December 2015 to October 2017 Software Engineer Aricent Gurgaon Haryana June 2013 to December 2015 PROJECT Mobile Number Portability MNP MNP is a service that allows mobile subscriber to change their subscription from one service provider to another without changing their mobile phone number Mobile number portability gateway enables number portability for operators in different countries MNP is supported validated enabled and managed by MCH Each telecommunications service provider must implement the carrierlevel systems NPG to communicate effectively with MCH All the updates received by NPG are sent to STP Signal Transfer Point with the help of applications EPAP ELAP and LSMS EPAP Eagle Provisioning Application Processor and ELAP EAGLE LNP Application Processor are applications developed by Tekelec now acquired by Oracle that runs on a MultiPurpose Server MPS hardware platform to support high speed provisioning of large databases for the EAGLE system These applications serve two major purposes 1 Accept and store data provisioned by the customer 2 Update customer provisioning data and reload databases on the DSM cards in the EAGLE LSMS Local Service Management System maintains a service providers LNP Local Number Portability data LNP allows a subscriber to change local service provider while keeping the same directory number EPAP EAGLE Provisioning Application Processor EPAP is a software that runs on an MPS hardware platform It collects and organizes customer provisioning data and forwards the data to EAGLE service module cards also known as DSM cards EPAP provides a shorter database lookup route for certain TCAP queries in a mobile network EPAP not just contains the GTT tables but also Real Time Database RTDB containing the information that formerly resides on the SCP Service Control Point or HLR Home Location Register EAGLE performs the database lookup and returns the response with the needed information in it without having to inquire the SCP I worked on following features on EPAP and ELAP 1 EPAP Expansion to 480M Database Entries 2 EPAP SNMP feature 3 Enhancement features like Support java 18 client MySQL 5631 support 4 ELAP Integration with mainstream TPD as supported on the E5APPB card 5 Support java 18 client MySQL 5631 support Disable Root

Following Agile methodology Senior Software Engineer Altran Gurgaon Haryana December 2015 to October 2017 Software Engineer Aricent Gurgaon Haryana June 2013 to December 2015 PROJECT Mobile Number Portability MNP MNP is a service that allows mobile subscriber to change their subscription from one service provider to another without changing their mobile phone number Mobile number portability gateway enables number portability for operators in different countries MNP is supported validated enabled and managed by MCH Each telecommunications service provider must implement the carrierlevel systems NPG to communicate effectively with MCH All the updates received by NPG are sent to STP Signal Transfer Point with the help of applications EPAP ELAP and LSMS EPAP Eagle Provisioning Application Processor and ELAP EAGLE LNP Application Processor are applications developed by Tekelec now acquired by Oracle that runs on a MultiPurpose Server MPS hardware platform to support high speed provisioning of large databases for the EAGLE system These applications serve two major purposes 1 Accept and store data provisioned by the customer 2 Update customer provisioning data and reload databases on the DSM cards in the EAGLE LSMS Local Service Management System maintains a service providers LNP Local Number Portability data LNP allows a subscriber to change local service provider while keeping the same directory number EPAP EAGLE Provisioning Application Processor EPAP is a software that runs on an MPS hardware platform It collects and organizes customer provisioning data and forwards the data to EAGLE service module cards also known as DSM cards EPAP provides a shorter database lookup route for certain TCAP queries in a mobile network EPAP not just contains the GTT tables but also Real Time Database RTDB containing the information that formerly resides on the SCP Service Control Point or HLR Home Location Register EAGLE performs the database lookup and returns the response with the needed information in it without having to inquire the SCP I worked on following features on EPAP and ELAP 1 EPAP Expansion to 480M Database Entries 2 EPAP SNMP feature 3
