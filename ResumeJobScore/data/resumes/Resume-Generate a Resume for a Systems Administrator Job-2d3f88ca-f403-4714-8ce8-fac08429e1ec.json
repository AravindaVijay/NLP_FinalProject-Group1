load the data from DynamoDB to Kafka topics for reporting and Used Git to control the build version Used Apache Kafka cluster as messaging system between the Microservices Used Apache Kafka for keeping the track of all the activities on the website used for some of the largescale message processing applications and Inter process messaging for temporary storage of messages rather than the messages being stored in long term memory storages Implemented the function to send and receive AMQP messages on RabbitMQ synchronously and asynchronously and send JMS message to Apache ActiveMQ on the edge device Used RabbitMQ Queues for implementation of multithreaded synchronization processes and used JMS queues for consumption requests Configured RabbitMQ as JMS service provider for processing service requests asynchronously MDB with backend and integrated applications Designed built and deployed a multitude application utilizing almost all the AWS stack Including EC2 MongoDB
