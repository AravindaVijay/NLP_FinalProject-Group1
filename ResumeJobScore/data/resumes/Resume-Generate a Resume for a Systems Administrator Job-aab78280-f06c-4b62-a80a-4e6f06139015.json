Protocol to reduce administrative overhead and to control VLANs and VXLANs using NXOS to ensure virtual and flexible subnets that extend farther across the network than previous generation of switches Implemented portprofiles in NXOS for multiple ports and porttypes to reduce errors and improve readability Enabled encryption of system passwords and privileged administration to prevent unauthorized IOS user access Implemented framerelay pointtopoint and multipoint WAN links between sites to establish connectivity between four sites Established framerelay pointtopoint connections between three sites to create a full mesh network Implemented hub and spoke network between three sites with the main office as the hub for redundant connections Implemented EIGRP routing for pointtopoint and NonBroadcast MultiAccess networks Prevented neighbor adjacencies forming and sendingreceiving routing updates on unnecessary interfaces Implemented EIGRP MD5 between sites to prevent unauthorized insertion of routes into the domain Implemented manual EIGRP route summarization to reduce demand on CPU resources memory and bandwidth used to maintain the routing tables Implemented multiplearea OSPF routing and totally stubby areas to lower the system resource utilization of devices Implemented NSSA area to allow injection of external routes into the area and propagation into the OSPF domain
