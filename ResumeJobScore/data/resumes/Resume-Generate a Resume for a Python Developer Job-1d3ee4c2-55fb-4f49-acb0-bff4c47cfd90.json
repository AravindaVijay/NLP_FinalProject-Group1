with opportunity for growth and advancement Work Experience Senior Software Developer Intelisent October 2012 to July 2019 Wrote a customized website in NET for a blue chip company from ground up SSIS was utilized to process files FTPed The files were placed in staging tables Data was then normalized and placed into appropriate tables referenced by website SSRS was used to write the reports exposed within the website The website exposed data for display purposes via 3rd party controls such as teleriks radgrid control The site was written to scale with millions of record being processed nightly The entire site and ancillary processes were coded in a period of about 3 months by myself only Site is still in operation to do this day supported by more junior level programmers After that project I was designated as project lead over the Webtrack product for Intelisent Requirements responsibilities Attend support as well as analyst driven meetings to gather requirements and place requirements into Axosofta requirements gathering tool Provide estimates of each task entered and assign tasks to appropriate releases Design responsibilities With end users management and support input design and layout the architecture needed to fulfill the requirements This ranged from choosing which 3rd party package to integrate into the Webtrack product to actual implementation of new supporting architecture I converted the system into a multifactor authentication system to tighten security I also had a conversation with analysts about feedback from clients as to how to integrate new users requests and struck a balance between giving what the users desired while at the same time ensuring architectural integrity Development responsibilities Create databases andor their supporting structures for any major development task Since the mail tracking world deals with a large number of recordsusually around 2 to 3 billion a year scaling was always important I sectioned off areas that could be improved by table partitioning and implemented partitioning on tables containing billions of records This allowed us to take on multiple blue chip companies with large datasets in a streamline fashion I coded all new UI development in the front end using a 3 tier architecture I moved the middle layer which was essentially coded in ADOnet to Entity Framework encapsulated into a new business object dll This dll was used from many areas of the product including web services autoloading SSIS packages and the website itself I also wrote all of the web service methods exposed to allow eternal customers to get data into our system without having to login to the website Many of the more complicated reports were also written by myself in SSRS and exposed either via subscription model or through the website itself This webtrack product typically had a release schedule of an every other month deployment I was the sole person responsible for deployments and worked off hours as to not infringe on any business hours activity During deployment my other responsibility was to ensure we were meeting our security audits via the Veracode system Thus during each release an additional deployment was made to their system as well where they would run security audits and give reports that I would then address to ensure we were meeting an adequate security grade Quality Assurance responsibilities During my last 3 years of employment with this company there were no quality assurance analysts on the team As such I was responsible for testing all code written and deployed Maintenance responsibilities Responsible for fixing any bugs associated with a release in the most timely manner possible so as to not limit end user productivity If the bug for a release was a hot issue that could not wait until the next deployment I would hotfix the issue to production during off hours Senior Software Engineer Scientific Research Corporation May 2004 to October 2012 Involved in the software lifecycle in the areas of requirementsdesign development testing and maintenance of web applications used by the United States Navy Requirements responsibilities Attend end user meetings to determine requirements gathering Determine and layout amount of effort needed to fulfill requirements within a given time frame and create schedule of work Design responsibilities With end users input design and layout the architecture needed to fulfill the requirements Development responsibilities Create the database to be used in such applications This includes everything from creation of tables stored proceduresfunctionsviews to maintaining revisions that update the database on both test and production servers Most of my work in this area has been performed in SQL Server 2008 Code and provide the ability to access this data from the database via another layer Many different technologies have been used in this layer Such technologies are ADONET data adapters Web Services Table Adapters and Linq If the assembly is likely to be referenced from more than one place it is strongly typed and placed in the GAC Code the UI for the application This includes writing C or VBNet code to create web pages as well as manage retrieving and saving data In some cases new web controls are needed In such cases I write controls such as a menugrid and dropdown checklist controls If reports are needed they are written as well either with Microsofts reporting engine or Crystal Reports Currently using Visual Studio 2008 as the framework for creation of the UI Authentication is another aspect of the web application that must be handled I am familiar with both forms and windows authentication Currently use forms authentication within applications Deployment of these application to both test and production servers is another responsibility I must adhere to Quality Assurance responsibilities There are no quality assurance analysts on the team As such I am responsible for testing all code written and deployed Maintenance responsibilities Responsible for fixing any bugs associated with a release in the most timely manner possible so as to not limit end user productivity I was Project lead for two web applications DGSITDeploying Group Systems Integration Testing and a Mission Thread Diagramming application The former application allows users to enter data into a web application after testing systems within a naval command This data was used to generate reports as well make any adjustments to a commands configuration Users could upload and download files to the server that were related to the testing procedure I was the sole programmer responsible for creation of the UI I wrote all web pages and reports used in the application The database was written for SQL Server 2005 and the web application was written in NET with Visual Studio 2005 Ajax was used extensively in this application by using update panels in many places Table adapters were used as the middle layer for communication between the UI and the database The latter application was a diagramming application for the web similar to Visio Users were allowed to layout missions by drawing activitiesnodes and connecting these activities with process flow information elements Naval commands were associated with each activity I allowed integration with Google Earth by auto generating a KML file which contained the commandships positions This allowed users to see where certain commands were at a given moment in time I created reports and graphs displaying mission thread data via SQL Server Reporting Services The database was created using SQL Server 2008 The web GUI was created using NET with Visual Studio 2008 Linq was utilized as the middle layer for communication between the UI and database A third party control Mindfusion was used for much of the diagramming functionality A web service was created to feed data for the generating of the google earth kml files I also worked as project lead on NTIRAs PRMPersonnel Requirements Manager This is an application that managed out year funding for US Fleet Cyber Command It allowed data entry by users which then is compiled into presentable powerpoint presentations for the pentagon Calculations are performed by the system to generate totals on a pay grade basis The application is written in NET 2010 Software

    "resume_data": "Senior Software Developer Senior span lSoftwarespan span lDeveloperspan Senior Software Developer Boca Raton FL To obtain a challenging development position at a dynamic company with opportunity for growth and advancement Work Experience Senior Software Developer Intelisent October 2012 to July 2019 Wrote a customized website in NET for a blue chip company from ground up SSIS was utilized to process files FTPed The files were placed in staging tables Data was then normalized and placed into appropriate tables referenced by website SSRS was used to write the reports exposed within the website The website exposed data for display purposes via 3rd party controls such as teleriks radgrid control The site was written to scale with millions of record being processed nightly The entire site and ancillary processes were coded in a period of about 3 months by myself only Site is still in operation to do this day supported by more junior level programmers After that project I was designated as project lead over the Webtrack product for Intelisent Requirements responsibilities Attend support as well as analyst driven meetings to gather requirements and place requirements into Axosofta requirements gathering tool Provide estimates of each task entered and assign tasks to appropriate releases Design responsibilities With end users management and support input design and layout the architecture needed to fulfill the requirements This ranged from choosing which 3rd party package to integrate into the Webtrack product to actual implementation of new supporting architecture I converted the system into a multifactor authentication system to tighten security I also had a conversation with analysts about feedback from clients as to how to integrate new users requests and struck a balance between giving what the users desired while at the same time ensuring architectural integrity Development responsibilities Create databases andor their supporting structures for any major development task Since the mail tracking world deals with a large number of recordsusually around 2 to 3 billion a year scaling was always important I sectioned off areas that could be improved by table partitioning and implemented partitioning on tables containing billions of records This allowed us to take on multiple blue chip companies with large datasets in a streamline fashion I coded all new UI development in the front end using a 3 tier architecture I moved the middle layer which was essentially coded in ADOnet to Entity Framework encapsulated into a new business object dll This dll was used from many areas of the product including web services autoloading SSIS packages and the website itself I also wrote all of the web service methods exposed to allow eternal customers to get data into our system without having to login to the website Many of the more complicated reports were also written by myself in SSRS and exposed either via subscription model or through the website itself This webtrack product typically had a release schedule of an every other month deployment I was the sole person responsible for deployments and worked off hours as to not infringe on any business hours activity During deployment my other responsibility was to ensure we were meeting our security audits via the Veracode system Thus during each release an additional deployment was made to their system as well where they would run security audits and give reports that I would then address to ensure we were meeting an adequate security grade Quality Assurance responsibilities During my last 3 years of employment with this company there were no quality assurance analysts on the team As such I was responsible for testing all code written and deployed Maintenance responsibilities Responsible for fixing any bugs associated with a release in the most timely manner possible so as to not limit end user productivity If the bug for a release was a hot issue that could not wait until the next deployment I would hotfix the issue to production during off hours Senior Software Engineer Scientific Research Corporation May 2004 to October 2012 Involved in the software lifecycle in the areas of requirementsdesign development testing and maintenance of web applications used by the United States Navy Requirements responsibilities Attend end user meetings to determine requirements gathering Determine and layout amount of effort needed to fulfill requirements within a given time frame and create schedule of work Design responsibilities With end users input design and layout the architecture needed to fulfill the requirements Development responsibilities Create the database to be used in such applications This includes everything from creation of tables stored proceduresfunctionsviews to maintaining revisions that update the database on both test and production servers Most of my work in this area has been performed in SQL Server 2008 Code and provide the ability to access this data from the database via another layer Many different technologies have been used in this layer Such technologies are ADONET data adapters Web Services Table Adapters and Linq If the assembly is likely to be referenced from more than one place it is strongly typed and placed in the GAC Code the UI for the application This includes writing C or VBNet code to create web pages as well as manage retrieving and saving data In some cases new web controls are needed In such cases I write controls such as a menugrid and dropdown checklist controls If reports are needed they are written as well either with Microsofts reporting engine or Crystal Reports Currently using Visual Studio 2008 as the framework for creation of the UI Authentication is another aspect of the web application that must be handled I am familiar with both forms and windows authentication Currently use forms authentication within applications Deployment of these application to both test and production servers is another responsibility I must adhere to Quality Assurance responsibilities There are no quality assurance analysts on the team As such I am responsible for testing all code written and deployed Maintenance responsibilities Responsible for fixing any bugs associated with a release in the most timely manner possible so as to not limit end user productivity I was Project lead for two web applications DGSITDeploying Group Systems Integration Testing and a Mission Thread Diagramming application The former application allows users to enter data into a web application after testing systems within a naval command This data was used to generate reports as well make any adjustments to a commands configuration Users could upload and download files to the server that were related to the testing procedure I was the sole programmer responsible for creation of the UI I wrote all web pages and reports used in the application The database was written for SQL Server 2005 and the web application was written in NET with Visual Studio 2005 Ajax was used extensively in this application by using update panels in many places Table adapters were used as the middle layer for communication between the UI and the database The latter application was a diagramming application for the web similar to Visio Users were allowed to layout missions by drawing activitiesnodes and connecting these activities with process flow information elements Naval commands were associated with each activity I allowed integration with Google Earth by auto generating a KML file which contained the commandships positions This allowed users to see where certain commands were at a given moment in time I created reports and graphs displaying mission thread data via SQL Server Reporting Services The database was created using SQL Server 2008 The web GUI was created using NET with Visual Studio 2008 Linq was utilized as the middle layer for communication between the UI and database A third party control Mindfusion was used for much of the diagramming functionality A web service was created to feed data for the generating of the google earth kml files I also worked as project lead on NTIRAs PRMPersonnel Requirements Manager This is an application that managed out year funding for US Fleet Cyber Command It allowed data entry by users which then is compiled into presentable powerpoint presentations for the pentagon Calculations are performed by the system to generate totals on a pay grade basis The application is written in NET 2010 Software Engineer III Blackbaud Inc Charleston SC April 1999 to April 2004 Involved in the software lifecycle in the areas of design development testing and maintenance of both accounting productsAccounts
