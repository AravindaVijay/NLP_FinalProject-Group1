applications to help people get work done My primary software experience for the past five years has been with C but before that I used C for several years Furthermore during my studies I used Java extensively Over the past five years Ive been with a project which has transitioned from an informal development process to a scrum variant process While working on this project Ive gained experience with the complexities of developing a very large application with a growing number of development teams Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Computer Scientist United States Air Force civilian Albuquerque NM February 2018 to Present Primary Languages CC modernPythonPowerShell In my position as senior computer scientist within the modeling and simulation branch of the Air Force Research Lab AFRLRDMW I directed programs related to directed energy DE modeling and simulation and coordinated teams in their software development efforts Sr Software Developer MEI Albuquerque NM April 2016 to February 2018 Primary Languages CC modernPythonPowerShell In my position with MEI Technologies I developed Directed Energy DE software models for the Air Force Research Lab AFRL and provided technical advice for various programs and eventsI primarily developed simulation models for the Advanced Framework for Simulation Integration and Modeling AFSIM With regards for the AFSIM models I developed the following High Powered ElectroMagnetics HPEM Model Lowfidelity simulation of HPEM beam propagation and its effects High Energy Laser HEL Weapon Model Mediumfidelity simulation of beam propagation and its effectsUsed in several AFRL studies Other Accomplishments I led the development and submission of the MEIT SPECDER proposal AFRL MS Development Team Technical lead for the model development team 7 member team Presented model development updates at AFSIM User Group Meetings and to AFSIM Directed Energy Working Group coordinates DoD DE modeling development for AFSIM provides input to the AFSIM DE roadmap Presented the models above at DEPS Directed Energy Professional Society symposium Software Training Trained model developers and analysts on new HEL and HPEM model capabilities Ensured that the latest models were available for AFRL studies and ACE events Enabled the successful integration of AFSIM in ACR17 Built and implemented a software development environment for AFRL developers This environment was instrumental to expedite model code generation as well as automatically testing the new models This has greatly reduced the time required to develop and implement new directed energy models at AFRL Lead Software Developer Baker Hughes Delft MN July 2013 to April 2016 Primary Languages CCC In this position I was hired as a midlevel software developer and grew into a developmentteam lead position as the project grew In the RDS branch of Baker Hughes I primarily worked on the JewelSuite software package which modeled the earth itself the reservoir within the earth various processes for oil and gas extraction and finally the simulation of that extraction Over the course my time on this project I worked on each of these elements of the JewelSuite software Initial Position in Albuquerque NM I was first hired at the Baker Hughes office in Albuquerque to develop the JewelSuite model integration with the CMG and Schlumberger ECLIPSE reservoir simulators This involved both converting the JewelSuite model into a format acceptable by these simulators as well as converting the simulation results back into a JewelSuite format for presentation with the JewelSuite software package Additionally in this position I wrote software to generate reports and graphs of the simulation results which would be appropriate for a reservoir engineer to use in presentations and papers Pilot Project with Royal Dutch Shell I instrumental in implementing the requirements for a pilot project with Shell which ultimately lead to a 40M 4year join venture between Baker Hughes Inc and Shell These requirements included running two separate simulators in tandem to describe both the reservoir extraction process as well as the geological deformation process resulting from the extraction Final Position in Delft Netherlands Since the pilot project with Shell was successful the software development team in the Netherlands was expanded from 3 teams 8 teams in order to accommodate the new project As part of this expansion I was offered a position at the Netherlands office and a team lead position with the new project During my time in the Netherlands I was the lead for a team of 6 individuals and was responsible for interfacing with management for planning purposes status and demonstration updates as well as software process implementation I also created a software quality group which created and implemented roadmaps for tools to ensure that software quality was being maintained and for automated that process Software Developer Baker Hughes Albuquerque NM February 2011 to July 2013 Primary Languages CCC Develop and maintain the reservoir simulation component of the JewelSuite product This component

Lab AFRL and provided technical advice for various programs and eventsI primarily developed simulation models for the Advanced Framework for Simulation Integration and Modeling AFSIM With regards for the AFSIM models I developed the following High Powered ElectroMagnetics HPEM Model Lowfidelity simulation of HPEM beam propagation and its effects High Energy Laser HEL Weapon Model Mediumfidelity simulation of beam propagation and its effectsUsed in several AFRL studies Other Accomplishments I led the development and submission of the MEIT SPECDER proposal AFRL MS Development Team Technical lead for the model development team 7 member team Presented model development updates at AFSIM User Group Meetings and to AFSIM Directed Energy Working Group coordinates DoD DE modeling development for AFSIM provides input to the AFSIM DE roadmap Presented the models above at DEPS Directed Energy Professional Society symposium Software Training Trained model developers and analysts on new HEL and HPEM model capabilities Ensured that the latest models were available for AFRL studies and ACE events Enabled the successful integration of AFSIM in ACR17 Built and implemented a software development environment for AFRL developers This environment was instrumental to expedite model code generation as well as automatically testing the new models This has greatly reduced the time required to develop and implement new directed energy models at AFRL Lead Software Developer Baker Hughes Delft MN July 2013 to April 2016 Primary Languages CCC In this position I was hired as a midlevel software developer and grew into a developmentteam lead position as the project grew In the RDS branch of Baker Hughes I primarily worked on the JewelSuite software package which modeled the earth itself the reservoir within the earth various processes for oil and gas extraction and finally the simulation of that extraction Over the course my time on this project I worked on each of these elements of the JewelSuite software Initial Position in Albuquerque NM I was first hired at the Baker Hughes office in Albuquerque to develop the JewelSuite model integration with the CMG and Schlumberger ECLIPSE reservoir simulators This involved both converting the JewelSuite model into a format acceptable by these simulators as well as converting the simulation results back into a JewelSuite format for presentation with the JewelSuite software package Additionally in this position I wrote software to generate reports and graphs of the simulation results which would be appropriate for a reservoir engineer to use in presentations and papers Pilot Project with Royal Dutch Shell I instrumental in implementing the requirements for a pilot project with Shell which ultimately lead to a 40M 4year join venture between Baker Hughes Inc and Shell These requirements included running two separate simulators in tandem to describe both the reservoir extraction process as well as the geological deformation process resulting from the extraction Final Position in Delft Netherlands Since the pilot project with Shell was successful the software development team in the Netherlands was expanded from 3 teams 8 teams in order to accommodate the new project As part of this expansion I was offered a position at the Netherlands office and a team lead position with the new project During my time in the Netherlands I was the lead for a team of 6 individuals and was responsible for interfacing with management for planning purposes status and demonstration updates as well as software process implementation I also created a software quality group which created and implemented roadmaps for tools to ensure that software quality was being maintained and for automated that
