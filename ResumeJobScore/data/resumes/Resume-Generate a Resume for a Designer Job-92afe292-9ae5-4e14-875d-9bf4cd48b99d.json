Information 210A 76th street 07047 Dear Ms Gina Lucia The adds you have posted on your website mactches my qualifications in graphic art I have remarkable skills in digital and graphic arts and I would make a great designer in and out of the field I ve had much experience with graphic and digital art in High School and posted my artwork on my website This skill has taught me many things about creativity When I make art in any design I notice that I am creating life on a blank piece of paper To me making art is bringing the creativity to life and to also give it any kind of emotions to it I have worked with many people who had more experience then me and have already started to work under you If you speak to them they can tell you more about my designs I am a hard worker and I will always do my best to get the job done I hope this has given you the thought of allowing me to work under you Hopefully we will have a chance to speak in person next week Thank you for your time and consideration Sincerely Ethan Araya Ethan Araya",
