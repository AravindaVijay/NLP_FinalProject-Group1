maintained in a database along with the details of the loan for repayment This data is filtered into different categories based on parameters like type of account loan amount due date The filtered data is used for statistics for generating reports Responsibilities Developed the front end of the application using web technologies such as HTML5 CSS3 ES5 SASS Javascript Configured routes using ReactRouter between React JS and Expressjs to render the templates from the serverside and Wrote reusable React JS components and managed states and props Used React JS with Redux to separate the data and presentation layer Utilized Redux stores to handle the states and update the UI Worked with Reducers React Containers to update the state of an APP produced by Redux and by mapping those to the React component using ReactRedux Accelerated app performance by using NodeJS clusters and improved scalability Achieved zero down time by utilizing the master and workers efficiently Coded and used Generators and Promises to resolve callback hells resulting in efficient and structured code Used Web pack in React JS to bundle the code and minifyuglify the Javascript and CSS files and to find any best practices violations and to create proxy to reroute XHR on systems Created load balancers using NGINX to health monitor servers and balance the traffic efficiently between servers to reduce the runtime Also cached static assets CSS JS Image files etc to reduce the load time Handled the UI of the application using React JS and wrote React components and efficiently managed routes to handle user events and bind the data Worked with new features of CSS3 such as media queries Flex box 3D Transforms Animations and few other in the application along with html5 such as Geolocation Drag and

ReactRouter between React JS and Expressjs to render the templates from the serverside and Wrote reusable React JS components and managed states and props Used React JS with Redux to separate the data and presentation layer Utilized Redux stores to handle the states and update the UI Worked with Reducers React Containers to update the state of an APP produced by Redux and by mapping those to the React component using ReactRedux Accelerated app performance by using NodeJS clusters and improved scalability Achieved zero down time by utilizing the master and workers efficiently Coded and used Generators and Promises to resolve callback hells resulting in efficient and structured code Used Web pack in React JS to bundle the code and minifyuglify the Javascript and CSS files and to find any best practices violations and to create proxy to reroute XHR on systems Created load balancers using NGINX to health monitor servers and balance the traffic efficiently between servers to reduce the runtime Also cached static assets CSS JS Image files etc to reduce the load time Handled the UI of the application using React JS and wrote React components and efficiently managed routes to handle user events and bind the data Worked with new features of CSS3 such as media queries Flex box 3D Transforms Animations and few other in the application along with html5 such as Geolocation Drag and Drop Web worker Validation etc Utilized React JS Virtual DOM to update the webpage which resulted in faster load time and rendering and Deployed the web page by using serverside rendering React JS
