New York NY August 2016 to December 2017 Project Description Role Responsibilities Played a developer role in developing an application which acts as an interface between systems and the management vendor product This interface is responsible for moving the data to the database that vendor product interacts with Played a key role in migrating the legacy loaders in to strategic loaders which is built completely on Java8 and spring Developed an UI to perform UAT loads on all the servers Arguments passed in from the UI will be used to execute a generic load script that I created This helped us a lot in reducing the time we take to load the data into UAT servers and at the same time reduced the turnaround time for our users Created a dashboard using Angular which would plot a linear graph of batch load timings and load times based on the date parameters Created a flat file comparison service which would compare the files row by row and if matched would compare the individual columns Once the comparison is done it would give out a detailed report about matched and unmatched results Made this tool available to the team members by creating an UI on top of it Implemented REST Microservices using spring boot Worked on java 8 features Migrating existing application into micro services architecture using Rest APIs spring boot Worked extensively with spring framework with modules like Spring AOP spring core Spring JDBC spring batch Spring MVC Creating new beans and wrote loosely coupled code utilizing dependency injection Played a key role in many other infrastructure

built completely on Java8 and spring Developed an UI to perform UAT loads on all the servers Arguments passed in from the UI will be used to execute a generic load script that I created This helped us a lot in reducing the time we take to load the data into UAT servers and at the same time reduced the turnaround time for our users Created a dashboard using Angular which would plot a linear graph of batch load timings and load times based on the date parameters Created a flat file comparison service which would compare the files row by row and if matched would compare the individual columns Once the comparison is done it would give out a detailed report about matched and unmatched results Made this tool available to the team members by creating an UI on top of it Implemented REST
