VA February 2015 to May 2017 Freddie Mac is implementing a new web application aiming at improving system performance meeting an increasing user demand and a better user experience The legacy application that was in use for more than 8 years was not meeting the current market demand in terms responsiveness application to application communication and accessibility In order to respond to these market needs we are using MVC and Angular JS which allow us to use 2 ways data binding and avoid round trip to server We are also using Bootstrap on the UI to improve the application responsiveness This application is composed mainly by 2 big parts The first part is the Admin Website also called internal website This web site is accessed only by Freddie Mac employees for internal use only The second part is the External web site also called the Front End Website which is mainly build for the public These 2 applications have some similarities but they are also different in some security and user functionalities Responsibilities Participated in business meeting and requirement gathering Involved in Discussion Board for Client Interaction for the change requests and followups

services to consumers using a tool that allows them to make thousands of automated calls and increases staff efficiency by not requiring them to make manual dials Most campaigns call consumers up to three times leaving voicemails for them if the Dialer cannot reach a live contact If a consumer calls them back there is no way for staff to update the Dialer as it is an outbound system only Because of this the Avaya Dialer must be updated on a daily basis with any information regarding customer callbacks The Dialer can only receive this information via a flat file The Avaya Dialer Callback website is a tool that allows them to post a subset of consumer data for everyone to access This consumer data matches the data inside the Dialer That way staff can go to the website when a consumer calls back regarding a voicemail they received from the Dialer The staff then updates records as calling back and that information is then sent to the Dialer The Callback website then creates the flat files needed to update the Dialer regarding the callbacks I was involved in requirement gathering with client estimation development both frontend backend and deployment in this project

VA February 2015 to May 2017 Freddie Mac is implementing a new web application aiming at improving system performance meeting an increasing user demand and a better user experience The legacy application that was in use for more than 8 years was not meeting the current market demand in terms responsiveness application to application communication and accessibility In order to respond to these market needs we are using MVC and Angular JS which allow us to use 2 ways data binding and avoid round trip to server We are also using Bootstrap on the UI to improve the application responsiveness This application is composed mainly by 2 big parts The first part is the Admin Website also called internal website This web site is accessed only by Freddie Mac employees for internal use only The second part is the External web site also called the Front End Website which is mainly build for the public These 2 applications have some similarities but they are also different in some security and user functionalities Responsibilities Participated in business meeting and requirement gathering Involved in Discussion Board for Client Interaction for the change requests and followups

services to consumers using a tool that allows them to make thousands of automated calls and increases staff efficiency by not requiring them to make manual dials Most campaigns call consumers up to three times leaving voicemails for them if the Dialer cannot reach a live contact If a consumer calls them back there is no way for staff to update the Dialer as it is an outbound system only Because of this the Avaya Dialer must be updated on a daily basis with any information regarding customer callbacks The Dialer can only receive this information via a flat file The Avaya Dialer Callback website is a tool that allows them to post a subset of consumer data for everyone to access This consumer data matches the data inside the Dialer That way staff can go to the website when a consumer calls back regarding a voicemail they received from the Dialer The staff then updates records as calling back and that information is then sent to the Dialer The Callback website then creates the flat files needed to update the Dialer regarding the callbacks I was involved in requirement gathering with client estimation development both frontend backend and deployment in this project
