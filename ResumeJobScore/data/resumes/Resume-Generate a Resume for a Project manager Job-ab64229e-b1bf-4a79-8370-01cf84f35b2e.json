custom filter Highly used Angular2 Router to build single page application for navigate through the different status and multiple modals Optimizing the code of reusability using the Decorators and injecting the services to access those in any components by using the property called providers in Angular2 Components Worked on Webpack as module builder for build workflow for Web Application Created unit test cases of Angular2 components services using Karmatestrunner and Jasmine Developed reusable style sheet partials using Sass Processor Involved in Writing jQuerybased Ajax Requests Developed Custom input elements using components Analyzing and resolving issues found during the testing or preproduction phases of the software delivery lifecycle coordinating changes with project team leader and crosswork team members Every technical detail has been documented in the confluence Wiki Used AngularJS as framework to create a Single Page Application SPA which can bind data to specific views and synchronized data with server Using Jenkins for continuous integration of builds Performed Unit testing using Jasmine and Karma Generated the Istanbul report on NPM test Followed best practices and standards for accessibility and crossbrowser compatibility Worked with version control GIT to manage the code repository Used JIRA to track the user stories and defects with agile technology Exposure to new features and issues addressed in Angular 20 Utilized the Dependency Injection mechanism for simpler way of managing the controllers and scopes Worked on Angularjs features like Two Way Binding Custom Directives Controllers Filters Services and Project Architecture React JS features like Components Lifecycle methods and unidirectional data flow using the Flux
