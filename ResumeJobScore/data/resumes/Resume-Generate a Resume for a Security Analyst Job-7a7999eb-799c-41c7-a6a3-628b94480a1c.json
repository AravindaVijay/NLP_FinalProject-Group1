I began working immediately following the time I turned eighteen My first job was working for NAPA an automotive parts outlet as a delivery driver I thought because I had a keen interest in doing anything with a motor taking a position at a business that dealt exclusively with autoparts seemed like a great start After working there only a few months I was promoted to counter man selling parts and excelling at assisting the customer in finding the correct parts for their needs Upon working there almost eight months I received the great news that I was to be a dad The problem at the time was that I was not making enough to support a family Realizing I needed to increase my income I needed to find a position with a company that would allow me to better provide for my new family So I began searching for an opportunity and soon thereafter found a job at a road construction company Baldwin Paving The compensation for my work there allowed me to not only better provide for my family but allowed for saving towards having a child Shortly after starting work at Baldwin Paving working there only a month I was promoted to Equipment Operator Things went fine during the six months which followed but then the economic recession hit the country hard and layoffs at Baldwin Paving began happening regularly My position was not immune and I was laid off in December of 2008 In order to improve my familys way of living and to offset the chances of being laid off as easily in the future I endeavored to become a trained professional and made the decision to attend college at Chattahoochee Tech While in school to make ends meet I took any odd jobs side jobs pretty much anything I could And after graduating from Chattahoochee Technical College I began my search for my first position in the field of Information Technology Fortunately I secured a position at a health services company Alere Health Working as a Service Desk Tier 1 position I cut my teeth on fundamental troubleshooting as well as learned to deal with customer service related issues Due to these skills I quickly advanced in my role and began to only handle the more technical or higher tiered issues that would arise Economics being what they are and as history always seems to repeat itself the yearly layoffs began at that company as well There was talk of moving the Service Desk which I had been a member of to India As the days rolled on staff on the tier 1 service desk left or were laid off and training measures were begun to bring the Indiabased tier 1 service desk members uptospeed on procedures for assisting customer calls I knew it was only a matter of time before my position with the company was no longer required and I would be laid off With that in mind I started another search for employment And after a few days of searching posting my resume filling out applications and such I was contacted by the owner of a small 3 employee clientbased IT contracting company XDCTech an MSP I worked for that company as a Junior Systems Engineer tier I While working for XDCTech I gained an array of IT knowledge being then in a position of needing to know how to support all sorts of brands of hardware and just as many varied kinds of software My employer at the time the owner of the company was amazed at how quickly I picked up and acquired new skills to both troubleshoot and understand the principals for all of the varied systems the company managed I was promoted to Systems Engineer tier II after only three months time And after six or so months one of the technicians moved and left the companys employ due to lack of enough workload with another leaving eventually for the same reasons The team of three suddenly shrunk to one and then the support of 45 individual clients was the responsibility of myself and my then Owner of the company Business continued to dwindle to nearly nothing and I decided to make my move to find something else in order to keep my family at the level of economic stability they needed to be at The next job search started in September of 2015 with a tech solution recruitment company Insight Global Within two weeks I had an interview with Cricket Wireless and was hired the day of I started work as a Security Analyst Systems Administrator III for the Retail Applications Support section of Cricket Wireless IT group and have been since the end of September of 2015 During my time at Cricket Wireless I have gained an understanding of both batch file and PowerShellbased scripting as well as the Application Development process My time at Cricket Wireless was spent learning to grow both professionally and personally to succeed in an enterprise company In the near Future I feel I could progress into more of a Management Position I feel that by knowing all possible technical IT issues and my team understanding that I was once where they are they would have confidence in me to be able to handle any situation that could arise A few more reasons that I feel I would excel in a management position are that I am fair enjoy teaching others new things have patience always have a drive to succeed which others will feed off of am a great listener and reliable and I always fight for what I believe in I will always lend an ear to listen Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Automation

workforce I began working immediately following the time I turned eighteen My first job was working for NAPA an automotive parts outlet as a delivery driver I thought because I had a keen interest in doing anything with a motor taking a position at a business that dealt exclusively with autoparts seemed like a great start After working there only a few months I was promoted to counter man selling parts and excelling at assisting the customer in finding the correct parts for their needs Upon working there almost eight months I received the great news that I was to be a dad The problem at the time was that I was not making enough to support a family Realizing I needed to increase my income I needed to find a position with a company that would allow me to better provide for my new family So I began searching for an opportunity and soon thereafter found a job at a road construction company Baldwin Paving The compensation for my work there allowed me to not only better provide for my family but allowed for saving towards having a child Shortly after starting work at Baldwin Paving working there only a month I was promoted to Equipment Operator Things went fine during the six

that would arise Economics being what they are and as history always seems to repeat itself the yearly layoffs began at that company as well There was talk of moving the Service Desk which I had been a member of to India As the days rolled on staff on the tier 1 service desk left or were laid off and training measures were begun to bring the Indiabased tier 1 service desk members uptospeed on procedures for assisting customer calls I knew it was only a matter of time before my position with the company was no longer required and I would be laid off With that in mind I started another search for employment And after a few days of searching posting my resume filling out applications and such I was contacted by the owner of a small 3 employee clientbased IT contracting company XDCTech an MSP I worked for that company as a Junior Systems Engineer tier I While working for XDCTech I gained an array of IT knowledge being then in a position of needing to know how to support all sorts of brands of hardware and just as many varied kinds of software My employer at the time the owner of the company was amazed at how quickly I picked up and acquired new skills to both troubleshoot and understand the principals for all of the varied systems the company managed I was promoted to Systems Engineer tier II after only three months time And after six or so months one of the technicians moved and left the companys employ due to lack of enough workload with another leaving eventually for the same reasons The team of three suddenly shrunk to one and then the support of 45 individual clients was the responsibility of myself and my then Owner of the company Business continued to dwindle to nearly nothing and I decided to make my move to find something else in order to keep my family at the level of economic stability they needed to be at The next job search started in September of 2015 with a tech solution recruitment company Insight Global Within two weeks I had an interview with Cricket Wireless and was hired the day of I started work as a Security Analyst Systems Administrator III for the Retail Applications Support section of Cricket Wireless IT group and have been since the end of September of 2015 During my time at Cricket Wireless I have gained an understanding of both batch file and PowerShellbased scripting as well as the Application Development process My time at Cricket Wireless was spent learning to grow both professionally and personally to succeed in an enterprise company In the near Future I feel I could progress into more of a Management Position I feel that by knowing all possible technical IT issues and my team understanding that I was once where they are they would have confidence in me to be able to handle any situation that could arise A few more reasons that I feel I would excel in a management position are that I am fair enjoy teaching others new things have patience always have a drive to succeed which others will feed off of am a great listener and reliable and I always fight for what I believe in I will always lend an ear to listen Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Automation
