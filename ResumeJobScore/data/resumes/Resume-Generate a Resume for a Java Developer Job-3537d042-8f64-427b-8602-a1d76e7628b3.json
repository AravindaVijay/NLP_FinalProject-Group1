NonProduction environment Creation Duplicate Databases using RMAN Backups Performance Tuning for Optimized results using ExplainPlan SQLTrace STATS PACK reports and AWR Reports Provided recommendations using ADDM reports Analyzed the trace files Using TKPROF utility Involved in Production Support for Critical Application Databases when needed Installing agent 12c on the server Adding High Available Database with CRS Scheduling Backups through OEM12c Generating AWRstatspack reports on regular basis to identify the database performance at peak load Tuning the SQL statement by
