a columnoriented report generator also published to the IIUG Software Library with documented plans for many enhancements o MathYapp a mathematical package of all manner of operations on polynomials including standard arithmetic solutions Lagrange and Hermite interpolation The system work entailed o Installing and configuring Ubuntu Linux and the GRUB for dual Boot on multiple computers implementation of the Logical Volume Manager LVM and tuning of kernel parameters Also installed Informix IDS 1170 database server o Repair restoration and configuration of Windows and Linux partitions

requested by user community WEX BankEFS LLC North Portland ME Ogden Utah Developed compliance reports using Informix Perl and Excel Galax E Somerset NJFiserv Shelton CT Performed a riskassessmentmitigation for a 0downtime migration of multiple database servers using Informix highavailability replication St Barnabas Medical Center Created a new infrastructure and restored an Informix server that had been lost along with its backups in a hardware failure Onyx Business Intelligence Dallas TX under Axiom Technology Group Lead DBA Migration Specialist Perl and Shell Developer Planned and implemented the migration of 15 Informix servers to a new data center following up with proactive administrations and optimization with the following highlights o Developed shell scripts to generate filename migration files to modify the names of database data files to conform to above standard as they were being restored from archives imposing a set of standards and naming conventions for all Informix servers being migrated o Developed Perl modules and many utilities to automate the administrative tasks of space maintenance eg creating dropping spaces and chunks data files as well as automated ie daemons and cronjobs monitoring of spaces and transaction logs o Recreated the Enterprise Replication environment as it had been originally implemented a feature that did not migrate cleanly with the restore Also implemented procedures to tear down and rebuild the entire ER subsystem when it becomes corrupted o Spearheaded the gradual migration of the largest tables to spaces with a larger page size resulting in faster throughput 50 Analyst September 2012 to June 2013 Generated space data needed for a database migration from Solaris to Linux as well as 32bit IDS 111 to 64bit 117 Wrote Shell and Perl scripts to help the team track function calls and space usage within the database as well as in the regular file systems Developed new modules in company nomenclature added testing code to some others integrated into several daemon processes to provide directory services to a data warehousing application Documented a complicated procedure that had been performed by rote for the past 12 years Telcordia April 2012 to July 2012 Migrated Shell scripts to Perl with an eye to speeding throughput Consolidated over 280 shell functions into one file of JSON structures to be used by a singlecall Perl interface resulting in 4053 faster throughput Wrote the benchmark script that obtained these results Rewrote Shell scripts in order to bring them in line with coding standards noticing repairing bugs along the way ATT Shannon Research Lab C August 2011 to February 2012 Added a filtercorrection to an application that tracks cell activity per call designed new administration tables and wrote 40 backend applications to associate users with their assigned features Hatzlacha West Spring Valley NY July 2011 to August 2011 Created a PowerPoint presentation

April 2009 Converted and upgraded an application from IDS 72 on Solaris 32bit to IDS 115 on Linux 64bit Sifted C and ESQLC code for compatibility issues related to the new 64bit environment At the same time converted the source control subsystem from SCCS to RCS Timken Ball Bearings Canton OH July 2008 to January 2009 Audited and redesigned the entire disklevel layout and adjusted the Informix servers tuning parameters to reduce disk contention The first pass reduced a load job from an allnight procedure to a onehour job Senior Informix Database Administrator Morgan Stanley November 2005 to July 2008 System Support Shell Perl SQL Environment consisting of over twohundred Informix servers distributed across dozens of host machines in North America Europe and Asia running 24x7 applications on Solaris and Linux Performed routine administrative tasks such as creation of new servers space allocation server upgrades duplication of servers on other hosts by manipulating backup sets Performed frequent troubleshooting on these systems eg orphaned sharedmemory segments frozen servers tweaking of server parameters for performance issues data extract of server status data and error messages Wrote many scripts to perform administrative function eg report on successfailure of backup jobs diagnose improperly configured database spaces identify invalid BLOB values monitor temp space during the run of a backup display the space occupied by a table Scripts were written in Korn shell and PERL Debugged and enhanced legacy administrative scripts eg periodic check for a blocked server scripts to perform unattended backuprecovery Provided occasional support for database issues closer to the applications Developed SQL to determine the identity of a locked stored procedure blocking the server noted when a different locking behavior might be more prudent for the users Senior Database Administrator Barnes Noble Inc April 1999 to October 2005 Application Support Shell Perl Informix Oracle C SQL PLSQL Routine and not so routine administrative tasks eg Installation and configuration of Informix and Oracle software space allocation user permissions in database environments databaseserver backup and recovery Additionally Application Support Although primarily a DBA rewrote some portions of applications with extreme results Rewrote a stored procedure in a highlevel language cutting the duration by 90 Similarly rewrote a Java application into another language cutting run time from 3 days to 3 hours When I was permitted to physically rearrange the spaces across disks the run time dropped to under one hour from the original 3 days Wrote scripts to alert the DBA of potential problems eg tablespacefilesystem capacity fragmentation resource usage on six HPUXInformix systems and six Oracle databases on four RS6000AIX systems Scripts were written in various combinations of PLSQL PERL AWK and Korn Shell Wrote additional scripts to defragment tables and reallocate space when the monitoring jobs did detect potential problems Developed a method to back up the Informix database to and recover from a single file system The backup now completes reliably in under four hours replacing a defective OmniBack scheme that previously ran over six hours Implemented a simulated lockquota monitor providing a feature not yet provided by the Informix software Published several
