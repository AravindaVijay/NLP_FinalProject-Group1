As a part of Business Middleware Applications our project is focused to complete standard credit card processes end to end named as SINGLE LENDING DESKTOP Our main goal is to migrate whole project from old legacy technology stack to newly in built framework named Fusion Framework within JPMC BMW to make easier for all the teams to make their services flexible to use other Fusion services Our Lending operations are currently dependent on minimum 3 Core Systems to complete standard credit processes This allows for business flexibility in maintaining controlled environment while allowing for changes to occur based on business need Eliminates High Risk Review manual controls As a flow of these module we interact with 7 different external clients and 6 back end services where we communicate with backend through web services calls SOAP and REST MQ calls Data power As part of our service we have different databases each of them has their own crucial roles like authentication and
