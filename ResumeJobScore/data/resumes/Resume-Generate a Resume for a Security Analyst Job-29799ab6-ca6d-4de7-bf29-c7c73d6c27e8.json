Phoenix AZ October 2018 to Present Developed backend software from scratch using Java SQL Spring and Hibernate 1 During training we had to implement a hotel backend that would validate credit card information names dates email and phone numbers using Regex 2 We had to implement a relational database and write bookings to the database Integrate features using Python Modified an existing code base of Java Spring and Hibernate and implemented SQL queries and gave a front end interface using TypeScript Bootstrap HTML and CSS 1 During training we had to implement a website for an online retailer internal use only There was an existing code base for the back end that needed modification 2 We populated users and items from a database and displayed different items depending on the page user and type of user consumer or seller 3 We had a fully functioning website that could be logged into registered view profile edit profile and buysell items Python Programmer Intern Kelli Ward for US Senate Tempe AZ January 2018 to September 2018 Worked with the candidate or a representative to come up with system requirements design requirement documentation for future use implemented requirements design testing requirements and implement testing requirements to ensure bugfree code We had a pay to use program that was crucial to the campaign and the campaign was informed that it would be down for 1 week before we had a major campaign event I rewrote this application from scratch over the weekend It was an application to send out text messages to a database of users and record responses for the candidate to view reports on All of this needed to be done from the phone I used the Twilio API for sending and receiving texts Other libraries used were glob flask and ngrok I automated others jobs on the campaign by analyzing their daily tasks One example was I automated a task that was to be done manually by two people everyday and would take about half a day I wrote a multipurpose program that would only require them to put a CSV file in a folder and run the cells of a Jupyter Notebook It kept track of voting information if someone has sent in a ballot where they were from if they moved or changed parties and a few other pieces of information This was to go in tangent with the texting app and our calling in order to streamline who we reached out to I wrote a twitter bot to keep track of tweets about various topics that the campaign needed to follow such as the candidate and opponents I used the Twitter API to get tweets and filter in different ways and used sentiment analysis in order to group types of tweets to be viewed later Software Engineer Intern Extended Reality Developer General Dynamics Mission Systems Scottsdale AZ August 2017 to May 2018 I worked on one long term project that used augmented reality Microsoft Hololens and virtual reality HTC Vive in order to map the environment from the Hololens to the virtual environment of the Vive Then the Vive users camera would scan them and they would be mapped into the Hololens environment inorder for two people to work remotely to reduce system downtime I designed Hololens modules to be integrated into the extended reality application I learned a new language and coding environment in order to perform my tasks on the project I explored documentation and online code for the Hololens which had minimal usable documentation at the time The documentation I wrote would be used for future internal projects I assisted in trade studies and design of the system Teaching Assistant and
