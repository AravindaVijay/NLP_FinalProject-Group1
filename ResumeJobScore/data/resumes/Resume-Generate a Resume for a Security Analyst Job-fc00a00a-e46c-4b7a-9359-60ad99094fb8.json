Hudson NOAH NoahsArk As part of the Hudson initiative which defines Trade Flow Requirements Prime Brokerage NOAH subsystem is required to interface and accept trade feeds from varied dependent systems like equities fixed incomes repurchases and Journals NOAH is a middlelayer message routerprocessing system NoahsArk is a reimplementation of the NOAH system using J2EE platform Leveraging the cuttingedge capabilities of J2EE message system the redesigned NOAH gained a message handling capacity that was faster highly available and much more scalable The primary purpose of NOAHNOAHSARK system is to transmit purchase and sale transactions PS and book keeping transactions BK from front office systems frontend trading order management systems and realtime trading to ADP using their proprietary intact message format based on Microsoft Excel and to other settlement systems like EUCLID and KEYLINK Involved in some of the silent features of NoahsArk to overcome NOAHS limitations

parameter maps wrapper around JDBC to execute procedures and Spring TransactionProxyFactoryBean for declarative transaction Changed applications to run in WAS 6 with code level to J2EE 14 changed security layer to use standard TAMWebSealAZN which involved changing stored procedures and application code Used MockStrutsTestCase extension of the base JUnit testcase to test Struts Action objects Used caching in iBATIS results by specifying a cache in the XML file including cache order FIFO LIFO and LRU Used DAO pattern to encapsulate data access calls Business Delegate pattern and injected through spring Environment WAS 60 RAD JDBC XML XSLT iBatis 215 Spring Framework JavaJ2EE Developer UBS Investment Bank CT March 2003 to May 2004 Hudson NOAH NoahsArk As part of the Hudson initiative which defines Trade Flow Requirements Prime Brokerage NOAH subsystem is required to interface and accept trade feeds from varied dependent systems like equities fixed incomes repurchases and Journals NOAH is a middlelayer message routerprocessing system NoahsArk is a reimplementation of the NOAH system using J2EE platform Leveraging the cuttingedge capabilities of J2EE message system the redesigned NOAH gained a message handling capacity that was faster highly available and much more scalable The primary purpose of NOAHNOAHSARK system is to transmit purchase and sale transactions PS and book keeping transactions BK from front office systems frontend trading order management systems and realtime trading to ADP using their proprietary intact message format based on Microsoft Excel and to other settlement systems like EUCLID and KEYLINK Involved in some of the silent features of NoahsArk to overcome NOAHS limitations which were single threadedprocedural model Metadatadriven approach reusable persistence layer generation multiple connectors NTier model Used spring framework extensively for JDBC development Dependency Injection and configurations through Bean Registry Wrote configurable multithreaded message parsers and reconciliation algorithms which persist to database also parsed Swift messages into XML format using JDOM Automated tasks using Autosys and SQLLoader for Solaris and Linux environments Built JUnit test cases to unit test various INTACT message sent as settlement messages to various systems EUROCLEAR KEYLINK EUCLID ADP IBATIS sqlmaps for
