Medical is a company that manufactures and distributes medical equipment to Health Care Facilities I was in charge of creating an Internal Full Stack Single Page Application that enabled RFID tracking of products within the companys warehouse The application required a Login Page for authorization Account Creation page and a Case Management Page that displays all the details of the cases Responsibilities Used Angular 45 HTML5 CSS3 and typescript to design and develop the front end Bootstrap and PrimeNG were used for tables and table functionalities to cut down on workload on the Case Management Page Implemented http request methods get post put and delete to perform CRUD operations Used a default pipe to display shipping dates to daymonthyear format and created a customized pipe filter to organize the displayed cases Used http interceptor to add Authorization to the outgoing http request header for verification of tokens with the back end Route Guard and Can Activate used JSON web tokens to maintain front end security Used Observables to define what was expected from the back end server to fix the asynchronous data setting problem of JavaScript Used form validation with the both templatedriven and react form to ensure that wrong data types cannot be sent to the back end database Front End Server functionalities were written and developed in a Service Typescript file to achieve component communication and enhance project resiliency Wrote queries using serverside technologies including Nodejs Expressjs and Mongoose Bcrypt was used to keep passwords secure through hashing Accounts are generated by Authorized Users on Account Creation Pages upon hire and passwords can only be changed via a password change request on the Login Page Upon sign up back end database queries the database for the username to make sure it is unique If it is not it will send a customized error message to be displayed in the front end All data was set to Models and saved into our Mongoose Database Created and developed a csv converter with JavaScript and Angular 45 for communication with the Impinj Speedway Receiver hardware Functionalities were developed in JavaScript Angular 45 and Nodejs My specialty is creating complex and resilient algorithms for Nodejs servers and triggers Used GIT for version control Slack for communication and Jira for Task Management

the Login Page Sign Up Page and Policy Display Page using React HTML5 CSS3 and Redux Created responsive UI using media query with Radium Policy Data and Claim Data are displayed in grid format using bootstrap Consolidated all shared functions into a Redux folder which used a Reducer to find what the components wanted to do and used Action to dispatch that function into the component Used States to define the Sign Up and Login Pages input fields and created a Check Validation function performs form validation to make sure the input values are of the correct data type Created a function that checks authentication token then attached that function in the Private Route object If the authentication function returns true React renders the specified component Else it redirects to the Login Page Created an Input component that exports a function to check what kind of input render is needed example text area email password All functionalities are written in JavaScript with render only rendering the current values of the State State values are changed with functions to ensure the displayed values are dynamic and changes with any new input Created an axiosjs file which exports a base URL for the other components to use to make requests to the back end server Back end triggers and Queries are written with Nodejs and use Expressjs to modify header acceptance Validation function also checks with the back end to determine whether the username provided is unique and will respond with a custom error message if its not Back end server also uses bcrypt to hash passwords and JSON web tokens to create authorization tokens for the users to use All data is stored in a Mongoose Database and can be fetched edited or dropped through the Nodejs server Used Models to determine the format of the data and their properties that were being stored into the Mongoose Database My specialty was designing the front end functionalities and handling all Redux pages Used Git for Version Control

Responsibilities Used Angular 45 HTML5 CSS3 and typescript to design and develop the front end Bootstrap and PrimeNG were used for tables and table functionalities to cut down on workload on the Case Management Page Implemented http request methods get post put and delete to perform CRUD operations Used a default pipe to display shipping dates to daymonthyear format and created a customized pipe filter to organize the displayed cases Used http interceptor to add Authorization to the outgoing http request header for verification of tokens with the back end Route Guard and Can Activate used JSON web tokens to maintain front end security Used Observables to define what was expected from the back end server to fix the asynchronous data setting problem of JavaScript Used form validation with the both templatedriven and react form to ensure that wrong data types cannot be sent to the back end database Front End Server functionalities were written and developed in a Service Typescript file to achieve component communication and enhance project resiliency Wrote queries using serverside technologies including Nodejs Expressjs and Mongoose Bcrypt was used to keep passwords secure through hashing Accounts are generated by Authorized Users on Account Creation Pages upon hire and passwords can only be changed via a password change request on the Login Page Upon sign up back end database queries the database for the username to make sure it is unique If it is not it will send a customized error message to be displayed in the front end All data was set to Models and saved into our Mongoose Database Created and developed a csv converter with JavaScript and Angular 45 for communication with the Impinj Speedway Receiver hardware Functionalities were developed in JavaScript Angular 45 and Nodejs My specialty is creating complex and resilient algorithms for Nodejs servers and triggers Used GIT for version control Slack for communication and Jira for Task Management

to define the Sign Up and Login Pages input fields and created a Check Validation function performs form validation to make sure the input values are of the correct data type Created a function that checks authentication token then attached that function in the Private Route object If the authentication function returns true React renders the specified component Else it redirects to the Login Page Created an Input component that exports a function to check what kind of input render is needed example text area email password All functionalities are written in JavaScript with render only rendering the current values of the State State values are changed with functions to ensure the displayed values are dynamic and changes with any new input Created an axiosjs file which exports a base URL for the other components to use to make requests to the back end server Back end triggers and Queries are written with Nodejs and use Expressjs to modify header acceptance Validation function also checks with the back end to determine whether the username provided is unique and will respond with a custom error message if its not Back end server also uses bcrypt to hash passwords and JSON web tokens to create authorization tokens for the users to use All data is stored in a Mongoose Database and can be fetched edited or dropped through the Nodejs server Used Models to determine the format
