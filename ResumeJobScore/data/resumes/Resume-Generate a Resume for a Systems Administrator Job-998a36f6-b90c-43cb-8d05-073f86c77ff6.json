operational tested and deployed Troubleshot issues with measures and formulas that would throw errors Worked with ETL developers to get source and reference data loaded correctly in the datamart to facilitate cube processing unknown member definition Advanced testing and early warning notification when datamart load didnt agree with source system through a auxiliary trueup process run following Cube reprocessing where Reports written against the OLTP source were programmatically compared with similar report from the OLAP aggregated datasource Implemented approach to and converted hugely complex monolithic and repetitive stored procedures being used by key greenfield SSRS Daily Metrics report being sourced from OLTP database to OLAP cube This approach efficiently surfaced multiple measures in a single MDX batch query making report development much more productive Rather than the former way with TSQL OLTP approach which required meticulous copy paste and wasteful pattern of 1 TSQL batch per measure periodicity New stored procedures were much more maintainable and leveraged a linked server pointing to Cube for MDX queryability from TSQL utilizing MDX OpenQuery and temp tables to progressively build portions of the final dataset in stored procedures The final dataset in the new stored procedures were in same format of prior OLTP based stored procedures only blazingly fast Returning the same resultset as the former stored procedures allowed the Daily Report RDL asset to be reused saving time and effort in this critical POC phase of the project Technologies used MS
