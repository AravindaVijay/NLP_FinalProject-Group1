and professional growth Work Experience IT Security Engineer Radford University Radford VA 2012 to Present Responsible for conducting regular security scans and vulnerability scans to test computer hardware software and networked devices of all types Develop summary reports from scans and provide to system owners Conduct followups to ensure that identified issues have been fully remediated Conduct penetration tests of new and installed systems working with system owners and custodians to remediate issues that are discovered during these tests Document test results and ensure that these are archived and available for audit if necessary Regularly perform penetration tests against University assets both on and offsite in an effort to confirm all border and internal protections are effective and no data is unintentionally exposed Installed configured and maintained campus Data Loss Prevention software Spirions IdentityFinder Designed developed and engineered campus security monitoring solution utilizing Gigamon network taps and collector open source Intrusion Detection Software Bro Snort and Suricata Implemented a dedicated multiserver Splunk environment to run the Enterprise Security Addon as rudimentary SIEM solution Event triggers in Splunk were then analyzed via dedicated Security logging server for all IDS and Bro events correlated with custom scripts Played an integral role designing developing and implementing a border firewall solution Conducted all vendor research and tested all potential solutions provided by the vendors and delivered reports to management with recommendations Designed developed and implemented and Intrusion Detection system utilizing open source tools for alerting and log management as well as network taps and vendorsupplied collectors Carefully monitored reports from logging and intrusion detection systems for security related events Coordinated resolution of identified issues with university stakeholders also collaborated with the Information Security Officer ISO to build and maintain new security tools as necessary for responding to potential threats Implement and maintain the appropriate balance of protective detective and corrective controls for agency IT systems commensurate with data sensitivity risk and systems criticality Configured tenableio deployment to utilize SSO and rolebased access to the system to aid in vulnerability mitigation tasks Provided assistance for the ISO with Incident Response which may include network forensics host forensics incident documentation coordination with systems personnel cooperation with Law Enforcement and communication to outside legal counsel Ensure the integrity of evidence and follow proper procedures so that investigations are brought to satisfactory conclusions and according to Radford policy Assisted the central help desk with the resolution of security incidents also responsible for troubleshooting technical and complex problems and resolve issues to completion Performed migration of vulnerability scanning solutions to tenableio from Rapid7 This included migrating all previous scans and policies as well as configuring the instance to allow systems administrators access to their assets in the system Work with system owners and administrators to remediate found issues Perform vulnerability scans against all new servers at each phase of the deployment cycle to ensure no known vulnerabilities Works with other members of IT and some end users to evaluate and provide secure configuration recommendations when needed Works with the ISO to manage and maintain University annual security awareness training Work with the ISO to maintain and edit University policy and standards to move towards NIST 80053 compliance
