The CA system provider provides the equipment and software to the broadcaster who then integrates the CA system into his equipment CA is not designed solely for DTV It can be used for digital radio broadcasts digital data broadcasts and nonbroadcast information and interactive services The different ECMs and EMMs required by each CA system are transmitted simultaneously Each settop box recognizes and uses the appropriate ECM and EMM needed for authorization The ATSC standard uses SimulCrypt MultiCrypt allows multiple CA systems to be used with one settop box by using a PC card with

Cassandra Elastic search ELK stack AngularJS OS UNIX windows 10 Database Oracle 10G Project Abstract Conditional access CA is a technology used to control access to digital television DTV services to authorized users by encrypting the transmitted programming CA has been used for years for payTV services There are numerous ATSC and DVBcompliant CA systems available for a broadcaster to choose from The CA system provider provides the equipment and software to the broadcaster who then integrates the CA system into his equipment CA is not designed solely for DTV It can be used for digital radio broadcasts digital data broadcasts and nonbroadcast information and interactive services The different ECMs and EMMs required by each CA system are transmitted simultaneously Each settop box recognizes and uses the appropriate ECM and EMM needed for authorization The ATSC standard uses SimulCrypt MultiCrypt allows multiple CA systems to be used with one settop box by using a PC card with an embedded smart card for each CA system used Each card is then plugged into a slot in the settop box Each card recognizes the ECM and EMM needed for authorization Responsibilities Design and Coding
