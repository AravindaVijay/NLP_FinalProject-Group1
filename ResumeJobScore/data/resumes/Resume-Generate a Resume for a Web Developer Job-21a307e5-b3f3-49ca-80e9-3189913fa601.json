November 2015 to January 2016 Responsibilities Even though this is technically just an internship I am responsible for the graphic design web design and social media of Chetneys Cakes In terms of the web design I am tasked with the retooling of the company website Accomplishments I think the major impact I have had is that I have helped better fulfill the vision of the owner I have done graphic design work in getting the materials ready that are necessary for the retooling of the current website The owner had all of these pictures of these custom cakes that she had created but they didnt have the background she desired She dreamed of her pictures having white backgrounds So I worked in Photoshop to fulfill her wish with all her photos which was quite the task because the original backgrounds of these photos were not easy to work with and there were so many of them Even though the work was tedious it is work that I am glad to have done because I couldnt have asked for a kinder person to work for I have added these new elements to the website Moreover in terms of the social media I noticed some seemingly minute problems that I thought could make a big difference if remedied For instance on my clients social media pages she would post links to her images as opposed to having the images actually appear on the social media site It may not seem like a big deal but I know as a user of social media many users may find this to be annoying and inconvenient Alleviating a small inconvenience can make a big difference to user experience I told my client this and she immediately made the corrections Furthermore on the website my client had a gallery of pictures Immediately I noticed that in one of her pictures a celebrity Zendaya was eating one of her cakes while giving thumbs up It was extremely surprising and so interestingI wanted to learn more but there werent any captions This was not the only picture with a celebrity in it either I told her that she definitely should have some sort of caption because people will want to know more about these pictures She agrees and thats what we are currently working onshe desires a testimonial page Skills Used So far I

was a phone malfunction that created miscommunication between another group member and I which caused some initial tension She was really mad at me cursing me out in front of a bunch of people I didnt understand what was going on I kept my cool and let her vent out her frustrations Thankfully we talked through it and figured out that neither of us was at fault and our teamwork and friendship really grew in that moment We are still friends to this daya fact that I look back on with great satisfaction because it could have ended up a lot differently Moreover we had a group member who at first was not fulfilling her obligations In turn the same group member that had been mad at me was furious and things could have gotten ugly I decided to play peace maker and reel the at first uncooperative

2017 to Present I dont really want to go into specifics but I have come to realize that this is a very important and impactful job at least at the school I work atI only really work at one school The kids are challenging but they are improving so much I push them to work really hard and to behave really well and even though they often can get frustrated by this its really cool to see how much theyve grown I am very grateful to have had this experience I have learned so much and I hope the kids have been able to learn from me as well WebGraphic Designer Internship Chetney Cakes Work at Home November 2015 to January 2016 Responsibilities Even though this is technically just an internship I am responsible for the graphic design web design and social media of Chetneys Cakes In terms of the web design I am tasked with the retooling of the company website Accomplishments I think the major impact I have had is that I have helped better fulfill the vision of the owner I have done graphic design work in getting the materials ready that are necessary for the retooling of the current website The owner had all of these pictures of these custom cakes that she had created but they didnt have the background she desired She dreamed of her pictures having white backgrounds So I worked in Photoshop to fulfill her wish with all her photos which was quite the task because the original backgrounds of these photos were not easy to work with and there were so many of them Even though the work was tedious it is work that I am glad to have done because I couldnt have asked for a kinder person to work for I have added these new elements to the website Moreover in terms of the social media I noticed some seemingly minute problems that I thought could make a big difference if remedied For instance on my clients social media pages she would post links to her images as opposed to having the images actually appear on the social media site It may not seem like a big deal but I know as a user of social media many users may find this to be annoying and inconvenient Alleviating a small inconvenience can make a big difference to user experience I told my client this and she immediately made the corrections Furthermore on the website my client had a gallery of pictures Immediately I noticed that in one of her pictures a celebrity Zendaya was eating one of her cakes while giving

have used graphic design web design and social media skills Update This is as far as we got on the project Web Designer Developer Images Hair Design Dayton NJ January 2015 to May 2015 Responsibilities My group members and I created a website for Images Hair Design We were responsible for creating a lot of the content from scratch Personally I was responsible for a lot of the coding as well as the testing of the website and photo editing Moreover I was one of the people sent over to interview the client to see what her vision for the website was Accomplishments I think that we did a great service for the company They actually had a live website before our involvement that was one of the worst websites I had ever seen Internet presence is a real aspect businesses have to consider these days and I think we helped place them in better footing Skills Used Obviously I had to use web and graphic design skills More importantly working in a group I had to use people skills I remember there was a phone malfunction that created miscommunication between another group member and I which caused some initial tension She was really mad at me cursing me out in front of a bunch of people I didnt understand what was going on I kept my cool and let her vent out her frustrations Thankfully we talked through it and figured out that neither of us was at fault and our teamwork and friendship really grew in that moment We are still friends to this daya fact that I look back on with great satisfaction because it could have ended up a lot differently Moreover we had a group member who at first was not fulfilling her obligations In turn the same group member that had been mad at me was furious and things could have gotten ugly I decided to play peace maker and reel the at first uncooperative member back into the fold by having her work together with me She was productive from then on out and the group got along really well Education Bachelors in Web Design Rider University Lawrenceville
