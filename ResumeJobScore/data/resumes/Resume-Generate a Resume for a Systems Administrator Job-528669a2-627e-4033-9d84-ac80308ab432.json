developer Ohio Department of Education June 2018 to Present Ohio Department of Education calculates and processes approximately 8 billion of school funding annually The data processing systems used are a mix of COBOL and SAS programs running on an OpenVMS mainframe reading from Oracle databases SAS datasets and flat files and writing to SAS datasets and flat files The Department seeks to modernize this data processing environment by reworking the system to utilize modern technologies specifically replacing COBOL and SAS on OpenVMS with Python on Windows and better leveraging databases where appropriate Responsibilities Design a new data processing system and architecture to perform multiple recurring time sensitive and mission critical funding processes each involving multiple programs calculation steps andor data sources Replace all COBOL and SAS code with Python 3 code potentially augmented with ODE owned reporting tools eg Tableau Make most data calculations reusable across multiple payment processes eg as a Python package Make the processes configurable so that simple changes such as constants or multiplication factors that may change each budget biennium can be changed at run time without requiring code changes and a formal software release Identify recommend and assist with implementing a Python 3 distribution CPython Anaconda etc appropriate for ODEs needs Work with ODE personnel to review existing legacy COBOL and SAS code to document business rules system process flow and identify process reengineering opportunities Replace legacy COBOL and SAS code by writing Python programs to implement the business logic within the context of the new reusable and configurable system architecture Creating a front end for the Payment processing system using Ajax and other front end technologies Assist andor replace legacy COBOL code that generate dynamic financial reports on the ODE web site with modern technologies eg Python Tableau Mentor ODE programmers as
