June 2015 to April 2016 Project Spectrum is the system facilitates the portfolio reconciliation between GoldmansachsGS and GS counter parties as per regulatory requirements Portfolio is a collection of trades between GS and GS counter party Portfolio Reconciliation is the process of comparing GS portfolio to the counter parties portfolio and highlighting any trade level discrepancies such as Market To Market values The system is based on Java based Spring architecture This Spectrum has a capability to groups  trades by portfolio sends those protfolios out for reconciliation and assists portfolio reconciliation operationsPort Rec OPS in reporting and resolving trade breaks that come as part of the reconciliation results The System also helps to provide consistency in process between two counter partiest The Spectrum enables to build Margin UI to provide Port Rec OPS to retrieve OTC result from reconciliation OPS use this UI to track the progress of reconciliation Used UML for developing Use Cases Sequence Diagrams and preliminary Class Diagrams for the system and involved in lowlevel design Extensively used IntelliJ IDE for building testing and deploying applications

June 2015 to April 2016 Project Spectrum is the system facilitates the portfolio reconciliation between GoldmansachsGS and GS counter parties as per regulatory requirements Portfolio is a collection of trades between GS and GS counter party Portfolio Reconciliation is the process of comparing GS portfolio to the counter parties portfolio and highlighting any trade level discrepancies such as Market To Market values The system is based on Java based Spring architecture This Spectrum has a capability to groups overthecounterOTC trades by portfolio sends those protfolios out for reconciliation and assists portfolio reconciliation operationsPort Rec OPS in reporting and resolving trade breaks that come as part of the reconciliation results The System also helps to provide consistency in process between two counter partiest The Spectrum enables to build Margin UI to provide Port Rec OPS to retrieve OTC result from reconciliation OPS use this UI to track the progress of reconciliation Used UML for developing Use Cases Sequence Diagrams and preliminary Class Diagrams for the system and involved in lowlevel design Extensively used IntelliJ IDE for building testing and
