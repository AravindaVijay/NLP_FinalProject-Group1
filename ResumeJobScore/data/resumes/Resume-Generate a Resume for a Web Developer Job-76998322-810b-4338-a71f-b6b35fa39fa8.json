architecture to choose for new software and reviewed existing architectures and optimized them to be scalable and perform better Created a distributed solution to do electronic faxes for medical practices and successfully deployed it to the production environment This was a scalable and extensible service oriented architecture that utilized queues which allowed the components to scale individually without limits based on the load Made an existing nonscalable application that created PDF documents for patients scalable by introducing a queued architecture this allowed the company to grow their customer base easily and increase profits Interfaced with external vendors to integrate application in order to retrieve electronic lab results Quest Labcorp and clinical decision support
