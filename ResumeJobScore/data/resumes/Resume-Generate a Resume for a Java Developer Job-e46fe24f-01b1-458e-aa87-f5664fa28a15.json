NY June 2015 to Present Maintain and modify financial programs for proprietary applications libraries Code test and troubleshoot financial programs mostly in UNIX Windows and Linux Oracle database and object oriented programming with design patterns and agile Designed and wrote Python and C code to create Monte Carlo XVA Trees and Partial Differential Equations models Model validation of equity derivatives vanilla options variance swaps and stochastic volatility derivatives Applied and developed techniques of Model Validation to ensure that the hedging and derivative pricing models do what they are intended to do Some of techniques used to model verification are deterministic models seed independency continuity testing dependency testing consistency testing and tracing Wrote C code to compute the counterparty credit exposure for swaps and fixed income derivatives Wrote C code to compute the price and risk management of fixed income derivatives Designed and wrote object oriented application to sample data to implement maximum likelihood and logistic regression models LPDs PD LGD and EAD credit models using python and C Developed financial applications to compute cash flows of securities such as bonds swaps repos swaptions caps and floors total return swaps for trading Designed and wrote code to build the unit interface of searching trades cash flows and collateral using directedacyclicgraph DAG in Python Agile methodologies were applied Developed SQL queries and designed table schema Unit testing in C and Boost test Quantitative Developer Financial Engineering
