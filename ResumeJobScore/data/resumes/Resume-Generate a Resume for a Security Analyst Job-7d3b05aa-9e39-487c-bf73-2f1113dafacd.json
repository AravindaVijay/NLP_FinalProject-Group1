Audit requirements migration of databases v Oracle 11g hosted on the old servers running on either SUSE Linux or RHEL 4 to the new servers some of them running on Virtual Machine boxes and EXAData X6 Machines running on RHEL 6 platform with Oracle version 12c 121020 Configure appropriate monitoring and respond to databaserelated alerts To test the Migration and Upgrade approach on the lab server using the database backups and document the steps involved before the actual migration that includes OS install usergroup setup ASM install and ASM disk creation 12c GRID and database software installations with the latest PSU patch applied Working with Data Modelers and Database Developers to deploy the database schema changes in QA External FunctionalRegression test env Q1load testing env and finally into the Production environment during the monthly releases using Oracles Edition Based Redefinition EBR approach Creating database editions changing the database services to point to the correct editions with every release Responsible for any production issues or performance issues for the application in my support bucket thereby analyzing and recommending fix for the issue in an attempt to improve the performance of the query database from execution time CPU usage and IO usage perspective Oracle Golden Gate Zero Downtime Schema Level Migration from 11g to 12c Creating SQL profiles for the reported queries with plan fluctuations picking the bad execution plans to fix them to use the best available plan with the optimizer with every execution To work with Oracle Support

implemented in the Dev and PreProd databases Providing advice to Software Engineers on the effective use of Oracle features troubleshooting exception processing needs and other data management issues Responsible for performance tuning requirements for the applications in my portfolio from the database standpoint and help resolve them and recommend the fixes in the best possible way using tools like Statspack AWR ADDM ASH Explain Plan Oradebug tkprof Oracle Advisories and so on Giving required Index recommendations creating SQL profile to avoid SQL plan fluctuations for long running and resource intensive applicationbusiness critical SQLsqueries to help improve the performance and reduce the execution time CPU usage and IO usage of the databases Keeping track of Oneoff patches and PSU patches applied to the databasesclusters in my portfolio To take schematable logical backups using Data Pump from Production and import them into PreProd environments as and when its required by the app teams for their test Running schema comparison reports between E3 E2 and E1 environments and identifying the differences and sharing the details with the app team Setting up Resource Manager for a few CPU IO bound databases wherein application database and system users are grouped into different consumer groups and are mapped to customized resource plans thereby defining priorities levels of resource allocations among various consumer groups Also specifying time duration or the resource limit CPU time or IO limit for a session to execute in a consumer group exceeding which the session
