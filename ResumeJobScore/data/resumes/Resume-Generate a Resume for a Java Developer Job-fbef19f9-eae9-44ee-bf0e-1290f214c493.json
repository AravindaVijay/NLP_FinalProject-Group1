business requirements analysis design development testing and support Participated in team meetings discussions with business analysts and created the scope and functional specifications to lay out the project phases Worked with the DBA team to develop the initial draft for the data model from the requirements Designed and developed a web site application using J2EE XML EJB Servlets JSP under the Apache Struts Framework stateless Session EJBs JMS JDBC JNDI Connection Pools IBM MQSeries and Sybase RDBMS Created the Hibernate Mapping files using Hibernate to access the data from database Used Core Java Multithreading and Collections like List Array List Hash Table and Map Implemented EJBs Stateless and Stateful session beans Developed web application using JSF Framework Used JQuery and JSF validation framework for front end validations Developed JDBC adopters and Assembly diagrams to communicate to the database Involved developing reusable web services using SOAP XML WSDL XML Schemas and JAXP Developed applications using Net Beans IDE and deployed in web logic application server Implemented Spring MVC module for repayment module Implemented Business Delegate Facade Service locator Data Access Object and Value Object design patterns Created war files deployed on WebLogic using ANT deployment tool Followed agile methodology Scrum Worked on Stories and involved into daily
