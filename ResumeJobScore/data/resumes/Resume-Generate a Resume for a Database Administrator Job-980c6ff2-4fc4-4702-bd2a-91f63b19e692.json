measuring electricity prevention of power waste etc This acts as a communication between users and power utilization This project deals with the electricity measure consumed by residents and industries We developed a software which measures electricity consumed and stores the statistics in an Oracle database The system will query the database for every 30 days once in a month and based on the statistics it estimates bill and next month estimated usage It will also suggest customersusers regarding unnecessary wastage of power and how they can save power bill Education MS in Computer
