July 2016 to Present Utilized RAC Dataguard and Goldengate to setup databases in clustered and nonclustered environments and implement maximum availability architecture Upgraded from 11g RAC to 12c RAC and administered the database through ASM SRVCTL and CRSCTL Applied all necessary patches for improved performance and security Extensively worked on creating volume and configured ACFS and Oracle databases on ASM disk groups with ASM filesystems Skillfully configured and troubleshot Dataguard and Goldengate for 11g and 12c versions and Goldengate RAC active configuration Utilized GGSCI to administer extract pump and replicate functions and to review error logs to troubleshoot Abend scenarios Strategically configured Goldengate Bidirectional replication and utilized CDR parameters Implemented backup strategies with RMAN catalog and no catalog methods and used RMAN to perform full database and schema refreshes Monitored application security and created and assigned all user accounts passwords roles and privileges Improved system performance through extensive use of hints indexes and Explain Plan Managed 10TB high volume production databases and all physical standby databases Performed data file recoveries from logical and physical block corruptions Communicated effectively and concisely with technical and nontechnical customers Utilized AWR reports ASH ADDM and SQL code optimization to monitor performance during peak and nonpeak loads Implemented range list hash sub partitions and refresh creation and scheduling for materialized views to develop large table partitioning strategies Wrote more efficient SQLs to perform increased SQL tuning Utilized ADDM and SQL Tuning Advisor in 10g to tune SWL and database instance parameters to improve performance Responsible for all backup recovery and upgrading all PostgreSQL Databases Performed migration from oracle to PostgreSQL Monitoring databases to optimize database performance and diagnosing any issues

the correct AWS services Skillfully and efficiently deployed managed and operated scalable highly available and fault tolerant systems using AWS Patched windows EC2 instances using AWS system manager patch manager Implemented Amazon RDS for high availability and failover to support Database instances using MULTIAZ deployments Set up RDS by installing roles and revoking when necessary Implemented Amazon RDS read replicas to enhance performance and sustainability for database instances Acted as Scrum Master for product teams with a focus on guiding teams toward enhancing work performance Acted as project manager when necessary Built excellent relationship with product owner and other stake holders to facilitate teams interaction with them Facilitated in getting work done by assigning job task without coercion Organized and facilitated project planning daily meetings reviews sprint release planning demos and other scrum related meetings Worked hand in hand with scrum and product owner to negociate the minimum viable product for actual delivery Uploaded Agile Tracking systems to provide real transparency on product and sprint backlogs Took responsibility of delivery and task management Facilitated the removal of impediments by finding the right personnel to perform the task Helped team to solve problems rather than providing solutions Coached team members on Agile principles and providing general guidance on methodology Coached product owners in creation and maintenance of product Backlog Oracle Database Administrator Scrum master HMS Hosts Bethesda MD March 2012 to July 2016 Installed and configured 10205 and 11107 databases on AIX platforms Configured Dataguard used hot backups to create physical standby databases troubleshot standby errors and manually registered archive logs Wrote shell script embedded RMAN scripts to schedule and test backups on databases Applied archive and redo logs to recover full databases Duplicated and optimized database backups through RMAN and RAC on remote hosts Utilized importexport to load user data daily and schemas as recovery in times of logical corruption Created new databases and instances on 12c11g RAC and used customized scripts and DBCA for single instances Honed skills in SQL scripting PLSQL coding stored procedures functions packages and triggers for enforcing referential integrity constraints Used OEM 10g Grid Control to monitor databases and application servers Developed UNIX scripts to automate processes including file movement alert log management and backups Improved performance by reorganizing databases schemas and tables Applied all patches for RAC and nonRAC server issues during upgrades and DR switchover testing Configured Goldengate for uni and bidirectional replication
