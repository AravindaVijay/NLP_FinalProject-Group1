of Fixed Income project Enchiladas is to build a Debt Processing Engine which can generate OID accrual schedules for both Corporate and Municipal bonds that maymay not be OID eligible and to process Fixed Income transactions determine the purchase condition and apply the appropriate cost basis adjustments In addition the engine will also need functionality to create accrual schedules for Complex Debt instruments such as Contingent Debt Variable Rate Debt Inflation indexed Stepped Rate Paymentinkind QSI Deferred STRIPS and Fixed Rate Capital securities This project is divided into Day 1 and Day 2 Day 1 requirements include Less Complex Debt securities and calculations Day 2 Requirements include More Complex Debt securities and calculations RESPONSIBILITIES Designed and developed the Enchiladas Fixed Income Engine The core Engine calculates the Base OID Schedule Payment Schedule Accrual schedule depending upon if the Adjustment type is Bond Premium Acquisition Premium or Market Discount Developed the OID YTM Yield to Maturity calculator using Newton Rhapsody method Developed the Engine project as a library a Maven project Designed and developed the REST API using JAXRS

technical registration information and lineage defined before it is stored in the data reservoir UDS Unified Data Service strives to maintain information about the endtoend flow of data in the Ecosystem consisting of serviceoriented technical operational security and workload specific information associated with the data and its processes Usually Customer PII data Personally Identifiable Information is registered for a later consumption Ingestion This PII data can be shared across LOBs as well UDS Registration portal allows business user register zones which helps to connect different data sources register data domains and data sets It allows to register unified data processors and data flows as well these components will be used in ingestion application to ingest data into Hadoop environment and further data will be used for data analytics RESPONSIBILITIES Singlehandedly createdmaintained workflow using Core Java Collection Spring Restful Spring MVC to implement CRUD functionality on functionalities at Tenant and DataSet Level Designed application modules using microservices architecture Used Core Java Collection Framework and DAO Layer to implement this Used Spring Integration Spring Boot and Core Java to build and connect Intra applications components Createdmaintained Inmemory Junit test cases to incorporate End to End testing Also provided Junit test cases using Mockito PowerMockito mocking frameworks for portal project Createdmaintained batch jobs using Spring Batch and Spring Boot for EOD batch processing of Customer data related batch jobs
