Subject Vanessa Klinger Hello Vanessa came to us on a temporary contract assignment We were hoping that we would have a permanent position unfortunately that did not work out and the contemplated position remains vacant to this day If I had to describe Vanessa in the fewest words possible I would say Aggressively Helpful and resourceful at problem solving Aside from being competent and a hardworking individual I found Vanessa ready to assist others when her workload was less than full a characteristic that can be hard to find While she was with us and without prompting Vanessa documented the operating details of this our company daily activity This book has become a reference for anyone seeking to find out about anything about our operations The book covers all of our daily activity from inputting work into our database inputting financial information into Excel to whom to call for maintenance It contains stepbystep directions for specific vendor forms When I first got here this organization only had three people in my division The Company did not have a work flow and tracking database for reference purposes I created a work flow and historical record database as we then did approximately 700 valuations the year now 1000 Of course I did this early on in my employment while attending classes for certification By the time Vanessa got here we were still using the database but it had not been updated or further automated for years since core activities did not allow time to work on this particular project Although we use Microsoft Access it is not very simple or intuitive when you move past simple database functions Vanessa took over the database from me adding several enhancements that are still in use today reports queries and enhanced input capabilities Our time with Vanessa was too short but we continue to benefit from her presence and work that was done with our company It is too bad our owner did not create the position We could have benefited from Vanessas other skills which include her creative ability strong leadership ability and education Obviously we would recommend Vanessa for any employment situation Thanks Douglas E Teten 701 S

Subject Vanessa Klinger Hello Vanessa came to us on a temporary contract assignment We were hoping that we would have a permanent position unfortunately that did not work out and the contemplated position remains vacant to this day If I had to describe Vanessa in the fewest words possible I would say Aggressively Helpful and resourceful at problem solving Aside from being competent and a hardworking individual I found Vanessa ready to assist others when her workload was less than full a characteristic that can be hard to find While she was with us and without prompting Vanessa documented the operating details of this our company daily activity This book has become a reference for anyone seeking to find out about anything about our operations The book covers all of our daily activity from inputting work into our database inputting financial information into Excel to whom to call for maintenance It contains stepbystep directions for specific vendor forms When I first got here this organization only had three people in my division The Company did not have a work flow and tracking database for reference purposes I created a work flow and historical record database as we then did approximately 700 valuations the year now 1000 Of course I did this early on in my employment while attending classes for certification By the time Vanessa got here we were still using the database but it had not been updated or further automated for years since core activities did not allow time to work on this particular project Although we use Microsoft Access it is not very simple or intuitive when you move past simple database functions Vanessa took over the database from me adding several enhancements that are still in use today reports queries and enhanced input capabilities Our time with Vanessa was too short but we continue to benefit from her presence and work that was done with our company It is too bad our owner did not create the position We could have benefited from Vanessas other skills which include her creative ability strong leadership ability and education Obviously we would recommend Vanessa for any employment situation Thanks Douglas E Teten 701 S
