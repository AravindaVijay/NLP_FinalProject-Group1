the Applications under Test to custom hardware distributed across global geographic locations Builds could be queued within the system directly from a developers sandbox from anywhere in the world where the new software would be built and automatically smoke tested System was distributed across global geographic locations could automatically select appropriate hardware configuration to execute test cases that were matched directly to the type of hardware architecture being tested Developed the framework using Python Requirement gathering design develop integration and deployment tool The

framework There are various components of billing management process Module which I worked on is to develop automated framework which enables to test the individual components of the entire system Individual components provide RESTful API service The developed frameworks base framework is opencafe The framework is developed using Python My Role in this project is Technical Lead for the team of 4 developers Understand the requirements of the project Make the design and implementation plan of the project Assign the tasks to developers and review the code Deliver the quality code and deploy build through Jenkins Project 2 BSL is a billing service layer that contains various operations related to billing operations This service has various micro services which are interrelated together as a system 1 BSL 10 contains operations such as getbalance getcurrent cycles etc There are 18 apis related to it 2 BSL 20 provides system related api operations There are 10 apis related to it 3 Payment Service acts as a gateway for accepting payments for different products Rackspace provide 4 BSL Syncs are processprograms that consumes the feeds from Atomhopper and calls the BSL and PSL apis to migrate the data to underlying Oracle BRM There are 8 sync pieces such as Billing Account Creation Process Billing Account Updation Process etc which run continuously to consume feeds for Atomhopper These are subscribers to the Atomhopper Publishers to this atomhopper are Signup service Usage monitoring Service etc Developed using Python on Django framework Designed developed and unit tested the

the Applications under Test to custom hardware distributed across global geographic locations Builds could be queued within the system directly from a developers sandbox from anywhere in the world where the new software would be built and automatically smoke tested System was distributed across global geographic locations could automatically select appropriate hardware configuration to execute test cases that were matched directly to the type of hardware architecture being tested Developed the framework using Python Requirement gathering design develop integration and deployment tool The tool reads the user inputs reads configuration xml file creates the original build by getting files from the Git version control Makes the build and upon successful completion of build deploys to the hardware and runs the required test suite Every step informs the user about the completion of job with an email Enhanced to automatically select appropriate hardware configurationxml to execute test
