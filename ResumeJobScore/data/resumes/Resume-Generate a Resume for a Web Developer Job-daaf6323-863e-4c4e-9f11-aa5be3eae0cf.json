management when we released new versions of the APIs I would also interface with QA and product management teams helping triage and coordinate issues that our development teams needed to address I later transitioned back into pure development efforts I helped in the transition to using Amazon cloud services for our back end coding efforts This includes both legacy and new development efforts as
