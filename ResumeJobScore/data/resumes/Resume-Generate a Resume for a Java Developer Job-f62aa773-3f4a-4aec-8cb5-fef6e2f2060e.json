financialtrading experience in developing object oriented data driven realtime solutions I have worked with multiple operating systems including Linux UNIX and Windows Ive worked extensively with multithreading and asynchronous messaging to meet design requirements for low latency and high throughput I have worked at nearly every level in the trading stack from exchange gateways to algorithms to GUIs I have a solid quantitative background stemming from coursework as an undergrad in econometrics and recent coursework in the CFA program Level II Candidate I have also studied the pricing valuation and risk profiles of a number of different asset classes and derivatives including futures options swaps fixed income and currencies I have a passion for programming combined with a passion for understanding the underlying financial domain Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Gateway Developer Eagle Seven June 2015 to April 2017 Developed gateways to facilitate the arbitrage of CDS Index Futures through the Bloomberg FIX API the GFIC and ICE APIs Upgraded the firms Asian gateways OSE and TOCOM to the new OMEXJGATE platform Upgraded the firms Eurex gateways from 25 30 40 Developed Python scripts to analyze and histogram log files of performance metrics Developed a testing framework in Python to automate testing of disparate exchange gateways by generating order routing scenarios from XML scripts The python clients generated binary TCPIP messages consistent among gateways which were then translated to the gateway API and forwarded on to the exchange Developed python scripts to replay market data captured by wireshark in pcap files to our different gateway market data feed handlers Technologies C 981114 STL boost Python GNU tool chain Git

Consultant CNET Developer ITG April 2008 to March 2009 Developed an execution platform for a statistical arbitrage trading algorithm simultaneously trading up to 500 pairs of equities The application was developed for the Linux platform in C Developed a pointandclick futures and equity trading application frontend in C Winforms 20 The application view employed an Infragistics UltraGrid control to display prices and market depth The model supporting the view used synchronized threads to write real time price and order data to ADONET data tables and asynchronously read the data to update the

custom 3rdparty control suites including Infragistics and ChartFX The application was supported by a couple of native VC COM components that interfaced with the streaming data providers and the iSeries boxes responsible for execution of orders on the exchanges I was directly involved in both the NET desktop and the development and extension of the COM component that communicated with the

financialtrading experience in developing object oriented data driven realtime solutions I have worked with multiple operating systems including Linux UNIX and Windows Ive worked extensively with multithreading and asynchronous messaging to meet design requirements for low latency and high throughput I have worked at nearly every level in the trading stack from exchange gateways to algorithms to GUIs I have a solid quantitative background stemming from coursework as an undergrad in econometrics and recent coursework in the CFA program Level II Candidate I have also studied the pricing valuation and risk profiles of a number of different asset classes and derivatives including futures options swaps fixed income and currencies I have a passion for programming combined with a passion for understanding the underlying financial domain Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Gateway Developer Eagle Seven June 2015 to April 2017 Developed gateways to facilitate the arbitrage of CDS Index Futures through the Bloomberg FIX API the GFIC and ICE APIs Upgraded the firms Asian gateways OSE and TOCOM to the new OMEXJGATE platform Upgraded the firms Eurex gateways from 25 30 40 Developed Python scripts to analyze and histogram log files of performance metrics Developed a testing framework in Python to automate testing of disparate exchange gateways by generating order routing scenarios from XML scripts The python clients generated binary TCPIP messages consistent among gateways which were then translated to the gateway API and forwarded on to the exchange Developed python scripts to replay market data captured by wireshark in pcap files to our different gateway market data feed handlers Technologies C 981114 STL boost Python GNU tool chain Git

Consultant CNET Developer ITG April 2008 to March 2009 Developed an execution platform for a statistical arbitrage trading algorithm simultaneously trading up to 500 pairs of equities The application was developed for the Linux platform in C Developed a pointandclick futures and equity trading application frontend in C Winforms 20 The application view employed an Infragistics UltraGrid control to display prices and market depth The model supporting the view used synchronized threads to write real time price and order data to ADONET data tables and asynchronously read the data to update the grid Technologies WinForms C NET 20 C STL VS 2005 CVS Eclipse Qt 4 Linux Fedora Distribution Infragistics Subversion LBM Consultant CNEY Developer Bear Stearns September 2005 to March 2008 I worked on a team to develop an integrated platform for trading equities options futures and fixed income securities The desktop client was developed for the NET platform using C and WinForms and a number of custom 3rdparty control suites including Infragistics and ChartFX The application was supported by a couple of native VC COM components that interfaced with the streaming data providers and the iSeries boxes responsible for execution of orders on the exchanges I was directly involved in both the NET desktop and the development and extension of the COM component that communicated with the iSeries boxes to support remote clients using a Tibco implementation This added significant value to the endproduct due to the revenue it could generate from clents Technologies NET C WinForms
