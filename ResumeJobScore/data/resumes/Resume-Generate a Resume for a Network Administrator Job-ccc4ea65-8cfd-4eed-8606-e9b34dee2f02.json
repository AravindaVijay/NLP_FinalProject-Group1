account and also in Oracle Client setup on clients workstation Worked on validating the access to dbs registered to ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY through Oracle Enterprise Manager and other tools Guided clients to make use of Centralized Database Authentication by helping them understand the architecture of ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY and configuring the db server to make use of Kerberos authentication and registering the database to ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY Lead the clients and peers in setting up named credentials in Oracle Enterprise Manager for privileged account and hence leveraging privileged account in accessing the dbs rather than shared service accounts and preferred credentials Resolved connection issues when using centralized db authentication Gathered details of how shared service accounts are used by clients in performing their daily maintenance tasks jobs that are scheduled using shared service accounts Queried and Listed out the Objects Procedures and Packages owned by the shared service accounts Analyzed and Documented the impact of locking these shared service accounts Gathered the set of privileges being used by shared service accounts and also the permissions needed on directories as well Analyzed around 100 perl scripts that are making using of the shared service account gathered the connection string privileges needed and objects used and procedures or functions being called by these scripts and privileges needed for the procedures and functions Categorized the these jobs based on functionality and privileges used Thus played a key role in designing

account and also in Oracle Client setup on clients workstation Worked on validating the access to dbs registered to ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY through Oracle Enterprise Manager and other tools Guided clients to make use of Centralized Database Authentication by helping them understand the architecture of ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY and configuring the db server to make use of Kerberos authentication and registering the database to ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY Lead the clients and peers in setting up named credentials in Oracle Enterprise Manager for privileged account and hence leveraging privileged account in accessing the dbs rather than shared service accounts and preferred credentials Resolved connection issues when using centralized db authentication Gathered details of how shared service accounts are used by clients in performing their daily maintenance tasks jobs that are scheduled using shared service accounts Queried and Listed out the Objects Procedures and Packages owned by the shared service accounts Analyzed and Documented the impact of locking these shared service accounts Gathered the set of privileges being used by shared service accounts and also the permissions needed on directories as well Analyzed around 100 perl scripts that are making using of the shared service account gathered the connection string privileges needed and objects used and procedures or functions being called by these scripts and privileges needed for the procedures and functions Categorized the these jobs based on functionality and privileges used Thus played a key role in designing of alternative through Centralized Database authentication privileged accounts to replace face less Shared Service Accounts that are in use currently Created Access Request Tool Requests To grant access to the team members for the database servers in various domains Created Change Request to create service account and keytab file that are essential for the kerberos authentication Created instance specific wallet directories to store the ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY credentials for the database and also created the soft links as needed so that dbca could place wallet files in instance specific location Performed the required nodelevel activities on db servers to make use of kerberos authentication and to meet prerequisites for registering the database to ORACLE VIRTUAL DIRECTORY
