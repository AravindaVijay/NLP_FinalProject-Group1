from development to production The task was completed in 3 weeks and earned high praise from the client as they did not have to invest in extra servers to handle the increased workload Oracle DBA Infotech Consulting Inc Mechanicsburg PA July 2000 to October 2000 Mechanicsburg PA I performed the task of Oracle Apps DBA on projects and in evaluating new versions of Oracle database server and other products like Oracle Application Release 11 and 11i I worked on various web related technologies including XML HTML JAVA for front end JAVA and PLSQL for middle tier and databases for back end I worked on these technologies under Windows NT and Sun Solaris SPARC platforms I also worked on setting up DNS server for the corporate web site Apache web server Apache Jserv qmail and NcFtp under Red Hat Linux 60 In addition I learnt basic CISCO router configuration to establish a web and network security policy using access lists and NAT features of CISCO I also used Webload from RADView to determine a web sites capability to perform under simulated load Duration August 1999 to December 1999 Project Construction Management System Sub contract CTA Topeka KS Job Title Oracle DBA Client Kansas Department of Transportation Worked as Oracle DBA on the KDOT CMS project The KDOT uses CMS to track all aspects of construction including contracts materials and utilities The CMS tables resided on Mainframe MVS under DB2 The project involved setting up Oracle replication between Oracle 8i Lite and Oracle on OS390 The front end used JAVA to manipulate Oracle 8i Lite tables and then using advanced replication these were replicated to the main Oracle database I created the logical data model from a reverse engineering of DB2 database transported this logical model into Oracle 8i on OS390 as a physical database and setup Oracle Transparent Gateway for DB2 Setup the replication between Oracle 8i server and Oracle 8iLite This enabled the client side JAVA application to work on a subset of data The proof of concept demo was based on creating the front end application both in VB and Visual Caf to allow the client to make a choice I earned appreciation from the project manager and project team for help in creating VB and JAVA screens Oracle Developer July 1998 to July 1999 Electronics Design and Development Engineer Yale University New Haven CT July 1984 to June 1998 New
