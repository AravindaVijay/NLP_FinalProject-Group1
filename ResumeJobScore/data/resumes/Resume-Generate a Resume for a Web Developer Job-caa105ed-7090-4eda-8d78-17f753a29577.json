Serviceguard is a product from HP which allows you to create high availability HA clusters so that services continue to run on cluster nodes with minimal interruption even if hardware software or network fails Any application that allows validating starting monitoring and stopping automatically can be given high availability by Serviceguard Serviceguard detects failures at the earliest and makes decisions dynamically to failover a package from an impotent node to the best node in the cluster It uses waits and loads to come up with the best node out of the eligible nodes in the cluster It uses quorum server to resolve split brain situation User is given flexibly to come up with his own configuration using a template configuration that decides which nodes comprise of the cluster which service runs on which node what are the other eligible nodes on which the service can failover to User can change the configuration and apply it dynamically to a running cluster User will also get alert notification on the package failures Responsibilities Involved in analysis design and development Developed specs that include Use Cases Class Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams Development of
