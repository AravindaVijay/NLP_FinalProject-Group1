costefficient embedded systems The Code Size affects the amount of system resources needed like ROM and RAM memory and processing capacity In our previous work we have estimated the Code Size based on CFP COSMIC Function Points within 15 accuracy with the purpose of deciding how much ROM memory to fit into products with high cost pressure Central in that work is the mapping between CFP and the information available early in the development process We have previously defined a UML Profile capturing the information needed for CFP measurement and estimation of Code Size The key idea was to extend UML components to contain all the necessary information In this paper we show how we developed a tool for automated estimation of Code Size based on our UML Profile The tool is designed to permit Code Size estimation based on other UML diagrams than components A case study evaluates the UML Profile and the tool in a realistic case",

that was working on development of TWM edocument management system for Custom Service of Armenia Later I was given more responsibilities of deploying updates on the production servers During these two years I worked with Java code debuggers Oracle XML JSP servlets both in Windows and Linux Redhat environments Developed a module for creating new customs brokers for TWM system Developed a reporting module that was providing the clients with over 100 different statistical reports helping them to have better insights about their transactions Trained the clients to use the TWM system in order to help them to perform their daily tasks Helped management with demonstrations of TWM system in order to acquire new clients Education English language English USA Language School May 2014 to August

costefficient embedded systems The Code Size affects the amount of system resources needed like ROM and RAM memory and processing capacity In our previous work we have estimated the Code Size based on CFP COSMIC Function Points within 15 accuracy with the purpose of deciding how much ROM memory to fit into products with high cost pressure Central in that work is the mapping between CFP and the information available early in the development process We have previously defined a UML Profile capturing the information needed for CFP measurement and estimation of Code Size The key idea was to extend UML components to contain all the necessary information In this paper we show how we developed a tool for automated estimation of Code Size based on our UML Profile The tool is designed to permit Code Size estimation based on other UML diagrams than components A case study evaluates the UML Profile and the tool in a realistic case",
