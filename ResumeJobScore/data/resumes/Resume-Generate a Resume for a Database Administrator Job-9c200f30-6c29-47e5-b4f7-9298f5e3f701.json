Pipeline Improvements Currently finalizing the decision for cloud providers going forward Our current provider will be shuttering operations in November 2019 Currently in talks with Azure and it looks like I will be able to get our environment migrated using Azure funding and hosted at a price that will save my company 60000 per year in hosting cost which also increases profitability in server sales as a direct result Oversaw transition from Development centric to Implementation centric model as beta product came closer to MVP Provided outside of the box solutions to fix multiple bugs

domain structure aliases etc Successfully lobbied to move the company away from an expensive custom and laborintensive payment processing application and toward leveraging a white label Virtual
