salesorder events to be used as a source of contract data needed to support the new Revenue Recognition aka REV REC revenue accounting process for product orders from all internal sales channels The Order Management OMNIChannel program included scope for this repository function from the perspective of providing the ability for ATT customers to initiate activities through any channel of their choosing In order to support REV REC this portion of the scope will be reprioritized in order to provide the Rev Rec solution with the required Order information In addition the Order Management program will utilize this new repository to enhance the customer ordering experience by providing the ability for our customers to do business seamlessly with ATT across any internal channel they choose and expand their functionality to do business how they want without the limitations of the individual ordering channels Responsible for creating APIs for Order Status for OrderSummary and

salesorder events to be used as a source of contract data needed to support the new Revenue Recognition aka REV REC revenue accounting process for product orders from all internal sales channels The Order Management OMNIChannel program included scope for this repository function from the perspective of providing the ability for ATT customers to initiate activities through any channel of their choosing In order to support REV REC this portion of the scope will be reprioritized in order to provide the Rev Rec solution with the required Order information In addition the Order Management program will utilize this new repository to enhance the customer ordering experience by providing the ability for our customers to do business seamlessly with ATT across any internal channel they choose and expand their functionality to do business how they want without the limitations of the individual ordering channels Responsible for creating APIs for Order Status for OrderSummary and
