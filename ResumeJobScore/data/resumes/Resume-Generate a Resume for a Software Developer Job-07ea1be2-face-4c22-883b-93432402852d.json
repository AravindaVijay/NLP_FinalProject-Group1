formation and cellulose expression by Bordetella avium 197N the causative agent of bordetellosis in birds and an opportunistic respiratory pathogen in humans httpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiiS300177via3Dihub 201701 Although bacterial cellulose synthase bcs operons are widespread within the Proteobacteria phylum subunits required for the partialacetylation of the polymer appear to be restricted to a few group soil plantassociated and phytopathogenic pseudomonads including Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and several Pseudomonas syringae pathovars However a bcs operon with acetylation subunits has also been annotated in the unrelated group respiratory pathogen Bordetella avium 197N Our comparison of subunit protein sequences and GC content analyses confirms the close similarity between the B avium 197N and pseudomonad operons and suggests that in both cases the cellulose synthase and acetylation subunits were acquired as a single unit Using static liquid microcosms we can confirm that B avium 197N expresses low levels of cellulose in airliquid interface biofilms and that biofilm strength and attachment levels could be increased by elevating cdiGMP levels like the pseudomonads but cellulose was not required for biofilm formation itself The finding that B avium 197N is capable of producing cellulose from a highlyconserved but relatively uncommon bcs operon raises the question of what functional role this modified polymer plays during the infection of the upper respiratory tract or survival between hosts

formation and cellulose expression by Bordetella avium 197N the causative agent of bordetellosis in birds and an opportunistic respiratory pathogen in humans httpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiiS0923250817300177via3Dihub 201701 Although bacterial cellulose synthase bcs operons are widespread within the Proteobacteria phylum subunits required for the partialacetylation of the polymer appear to be restricted to a few group soil plantassociated and phytopathogenic pseudomonads including Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and several Pseudomonas syringae pathovars However a bcs operon with acetylation subunits has also been annotated in the unrelated group respiratory pathogen Bordetella avium 197N Our comparison of subunit protein sequences and GC content analyses confirms the close similarity between the B avium 197N and pseudomonad operons and suggests that in both cases the cellulose synthase and acetylation subunits were acquired as a single unit Using static liquid microcosms we can confirm that B avium 197N expresses low levels of cellulose in airliquid interface biofilms and that biofilm strength and attachment levels could be increased by elevating cdiGMP levels like the pseudomonads but cellulose was not required for biofilm formation itself The finding that B avium 197N is capable of producing cellulose from a highlyconserved but relatively uncommon bcs operon raises the question of what functional role this modified polymer plays during the infection of the upper respiratory tract or survival between hosts and what environmental signals control its production Cellulose Expression in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and Other Environmental Pseudomonads
