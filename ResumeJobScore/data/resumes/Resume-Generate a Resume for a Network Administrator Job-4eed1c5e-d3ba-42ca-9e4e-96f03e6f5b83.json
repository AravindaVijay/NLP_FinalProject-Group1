the team by 20 Technology Java JSoup Libraries Mentored the TDP Technology Development Program Interns and also help new hires get an understanding of the technology stack of the application and the process Writing Intuitive and informational technical documentation for the software module developed so that new developers looking at the module in the future for designing and implementing an improvement understand the existing logic in place without hassle and save time reading the documentation and spend quality time designing solutions Wrote automated unit test cases using tools like Junit and Mockito which get executed as part of the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline this enables any errors or security vulnerabilities in the software module developed to be caught in the early stages of development thereby avoiding errors in code before the final deployment Software Developer Fannie Mae July 2014 to December 2014 Location Washington DC ProjectOverview I worked on the Multi Family Credit works application The application essentially does credit risk analysis of loans based on various scenarios and determines if a customer is in the risk on being a

Basking Ridge NJ December 2014 to Present ProjectOverview Electronic Payments and Statements EPS EPS is a service offered to health care providers to submit claims for payments to health insurance payers and receive those payments electronically in designated banks 32 Million Claims are processed daily and 300 000 payments totaling over 700M processed daily with over 25B a week Developed a centralized error notification utility based on observer design pattern improving workflow by 10 Technology Korn Shell Scripting Java SQL Accomplished 150 performance improvement for the PDF generator Utility by adapting the Master Slave Architecture by processing 3 times greater number of requests in 12 hours compared to prior design Technology Korn Shell Scripting Java SQL Itext PDF REST web services Spring Jackson Libraries and Hibernate Developed REST based Micro services for consuming as well as serving requests as part of the micro services architecture initiative for a more modular application Technology Java Spring REST web services SQL Jackson Libraries and Hibernate Developed a REST API Service with Oauth implementation to expose specific data from our application to another application within the company Technology Java Spring REST web services SQL Jackson Libraries and Hibernate Oauth2 Developed a REST API Client that consumes data from the national database to match the information of accounts for enrollments Technology Java Spring Boot REST web services SQL Jackson Libraries and Hibernate Oauth2 OkHttp Developed intuitive new user experience for 14Million Health

the team by 20 Technology Java JSoup Libraries Mentored the TDP Technology Development Program Interns and also help new hires get an understanding of the technology stack of the application and the process Writing Intuitive and informational technical documentation for the software module developed so that new developers looking at the module in the future for designing and implementing an improvement understand the existing logic in place without hassle and save time reading the documentation and spend quality time designing solutions Wrote automated unit test cases using tools like Junit and Mockito which get executed as part of the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline this enables any errors or security vulnerabilities in the software module developed to be caught in the early stages of development thereby avoiding errors in code before the final deployment Software Developer Fannie Mae July 2014 to December 2014 Location Washington DC ProjectOverview I worked on the Multi Family Credit works application The application essentially does credit risk analysis of loans based on various scenarios and determines if a customer is in the risk on being a defaulter The determination is based out of proven and tested financial models and mathematical algorithms Upgraded the MFCW multifamily credit works application connection to external and internal databases like Interest Rates Database by integrating EPV Enterprise password vault application code into existing code with REST APIs Technology JAVA RESTful APIs mySQL Wrote shell scripts to setup the environment so that the password for an external connection ID is pulled from Password Vault rather than an encrypted file Technology Korn Shell Scripting Password Vault Wrote a REST Consumer to pull the interest rates from IRDB and then use the data in custom models and algorithms Technology Java Spring REST web services Integrated MFindices to MFCW and wrote Ant Deploy scripts to deploy MFindices on the Grid Server and set permissions required to run the application Technology Integration of two applications ANT scripts Developed a custom JAVA and automated CSV generation with credit analysis data achieving 80 efficiency in the workflow Technology Java XML CSV libraries Set up the synchrony Interface between Risknet and MFCW for monthly transfer of files from MFCW to Risknet also
