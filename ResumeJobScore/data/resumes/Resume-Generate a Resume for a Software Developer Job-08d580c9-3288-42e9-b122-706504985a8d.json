HTML CSS JavaScript AJAX XML Python Django PHP Different testing methodologies like unit testing Integration testing performed Used Django Database APIs to access database objects Designed developed implemented and maintained solutions for using Docker Jenkins Git and Puppet for Microservices and continuous deployment Used data pipelining as embedded data processing engine which runs applications APIs transform and migrate data Handled potential points of failure through error handling and communication of failure Developed and maintained parsing modules which read CSV XML and JSON data from files and other REST services processed the data Maintained and updated existing automated solutions Responsible for user validations on client side as well as server side Interacted with QA to
