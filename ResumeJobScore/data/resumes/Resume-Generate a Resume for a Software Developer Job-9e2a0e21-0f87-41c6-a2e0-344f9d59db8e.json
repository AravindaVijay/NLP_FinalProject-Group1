Description Simple Warehouse is developed to simplify controlling of the realtime inventory in order to cut inventory costs dramatically increase profits Moreover our users can achieve full inventory visibility of all stocking locations including your warehouse and service fleet This Inventory Management System is essentially based on interacting with records in database Responsibilities Started with model layer and designed necessary entities create a JPA Entity to represent the business logics Developed in JSF to display the content sent by controller in form of query results Implemented Plain old Java objects and JPA Java Persistence API Utilized CDI Context Dependency Injection to bind different fields targeting query results Developed CRUD operations corresponding to the HTTP methods POST GET PUT and DELETE so that functions of managing records are achieved in the inventory model Used Maven to define datasource persistent units database type and beansxml CDI configuration file and triggers scanning for CDI beans Performed various test cases in JUnit for unit testing implemented Mock Objects using Easy Mock for reducing dependency and complete isolation for unit testing
