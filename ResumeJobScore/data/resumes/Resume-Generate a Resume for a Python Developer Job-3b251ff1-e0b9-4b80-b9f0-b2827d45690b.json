for user interfaces manufacturing processes and automated testing systems Work Experience Software Engineer in Test Microsoft Lehi UT February 2018 to Present Software EngineerProject Manager Special Ice Livermore CA July 2006 to Present Designed and developed a calendar web application for a tent rental company that ran on Tomcat This calendar application pulled events from database and displayed them to user This application used the data pulled from the database to help the user to determine manpower needed trucks needed traveling times and other critical information needed to help do the job better Technology used daily Java Servlet HTML JavaScript SQL Managed software projects through all stages and aspects including application programming software design scope goals and deliverables Developed and provided feedback on detailed technical project issues and plans AEM Developer Infield Digital San Francisco CA February 2016 to July 2016 Worked on backend development of

userinterface configuration tool for the microwave radio system Implemented the application in Java using IntelliJ and Eclipse Java IDE Designed implementation and supported automation test stations used for manufacturing a microwave radio terminal Created a Linux test station using Java to program an SD Card for the terminal Used opensource Linux OS offtheshelf hardware and a standard USB SD card reader to keep development costs low Designed developed and implemented PHP and Java for a customerfacing interface that transfers licenses to a USB dongle The interface enabled customers to create license files and install on the microwave radio terminal or transfer licenses to a USB dongle for later installation on the terminal Designed developed and implemented a Java application that installed from a USB dongle The application transferred a license from USB dongle to the microwave radio terminal using HTML calls SENIOR DESIGN ENGINEER Aviat Networks San Jose CA 2008 to 2010 Identified innovative solutions to meet industry programming needs relative to energy surveillance and security systems for cell sites Led design and development of an energy surveillance and security system for cell sites called Aviat EfficientSite including development of a userinterface configuration tool a SNMP manager and a Hybrid Energy manager Used MySQL Java HTML PHP and C Directed five engineers in design and development of the EfficientSite energy surveillance and security system for cell sites TIMOTHY McCARTHY 364 TORRINGTON DRIVE BRENTWOOD CA 94156 SOFTWARE ENGINEER Aviat Networks San Jose CA 2000 to 2008 Contributed to development of the userinterface configuration tool Portal for the microwave radio system This application was implemented in Java using IntelliJ Java IDE Designed implementation and supported automation test stations used for manufacturing of a microwave radio system This included the development of a Java application running on a Linux test station that programmed a compact flash with embedded code for the microwave radio system The application also queried Oracle using the sales order to request what license should be installed on the Compact Flash Managed all software changes in the XP4 microwave platform This included microwave radio embedded code network management card embedded code and the CLI code LEAD SOFTWARE TEST ENGINEER Harris Stratex Networks Seattle WA 1997 to 2000 Wrote test plans for the companys highestvolume product the XP4 microwave platform Managed and led four other software test engineers in the test of microwave system Tested embedded software changes on network manager card for microwave radio system Used Visual Basic and Dart PowerSNMP SNMP Agent ActiveX Control to create automated test for software changes to the SNMP Manager on the Network Manager Card Tested SNMP MIB changes using MGSOFT browser and compiler tested the SNMP MIB against the Network Manager Card SNMP embedded server Developed automated test of the microwave radio terminal user interface using Visual Test Performed systemlevel test of microwave and network management hardware ADVANCED LEARNING Managing Multiple Projects Objectives and Deadlines This intensive seminar increases management skills including advanced techniques for successfully managing concurrent projects competing priorities and critical

for user interfaces manufacturing processes and automated testing systems Work Experience Software Engineer in Test Microsoft Lehi UT February 2018 to Present Software EngineerProject Manager Special Ice Livermore CA July 2006 to Present Designed and developed a calendar web application for a tent rental company that ran on Tomcat This calendar application pulled events from database and displayed them to user This application used the data pulled from the database to help the user to determine manpower needed trucks needed traveling times and other critical information needed to help do the job better Technology used daily Java Servlet HTML JavaScript SQL Managed software projects through all stages and aspects including application programming software design scope goals and deliverables Developed and provided feedback on detailed technical project issues and plans AEM Developer Infield Digital San Francisco CA February 2016 to July 2016 Worked on backend development of projects developed with Adobe Experience Manager AEM CQ5 web content management system Technology used daily AEM Java Sling Java Core JavaScript HTML Java Swing Software Engineer AOptix Campbell CA March 2015 to January 2016 Designed and developed PathExplorer Application for AOptix a Laser and Microwave company This application used Google Map API JAVA HTML5 and JavaScript to setup needed parameters to get the Availability of the FSO and Eband Radio The application used the parameters in MATLAB to calculate the Availabilities The application took the Availabilities from MATLAB and displayed the results on both JavaScript Graphs and Java Graph Java technology used daily Swing JavaFX SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER Aviat Networks Santa Clara CA 2010 to 2014 Led development of the Portal userinterface configuration tool for the microwave radio system Implemented the application in Java using IntelliJ and Eclipse Java IDE Designed implementation and supported automation test stations used for manufacturing a microwave radio terminal Created a Linux test station using Java to program an SD Card for the terminal Used opensource Linux OS offtheshelf hardware and a standard USB SD card reader to keep development costs low Designed developed and implemented PHP and Java for a customerfacing interface that transfers licenses to a USB dongle The interface enabled customers to create license files and install on the microwave radio terminal or transfer licenses to a USB dongle for later installation on the terminal Designed developed and implemented a Java application that installed from a USB dongle The application transferred a license from USB dongle to the microwave radio terminal using HTML calls SENIOR DESIGN ENGINEER Aviat Networks San Jose CA 2008 to 2010 Identified innovative solutions to meet industry programming needs relative to energy surveillance and security systems for cell sites Led design and development of an energy surveillance and security system for cell sites called Aviat EfficientSite including development of a userinterface configuration tool a SNMP manager and a Hybrid Energy manager Used MySQL Java HTML PHP and C Directed five
