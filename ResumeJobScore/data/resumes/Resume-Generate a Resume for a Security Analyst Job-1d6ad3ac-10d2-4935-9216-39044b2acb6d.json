Enterprises Colorado Springs CO July 2006 to Present Developing custom software solutions for various clients Typically 3tier architectures consisting of a WinForms MVCpatterned GUI a business rule driven middle tier and a databasetransaction server back end Design patterns and multithreading are pervasive in my typical solutions and are implemented in the C language Currently developing in Visual Studio 2013 using Net 451 I embrace Microsoft Best Practices methods and patterns SQL Server 2012 is the most common database back end DB component Ongoing computer security research and development Some key areas of exploration include common software and website exploitation techniques such as buffer overflows XSS cross site scripting SQL injection Developed proficiency with many offensive and defensive hacking tools including Metasploit Ares Backtrack3 etc as well as packet sniffers and crafters remote vulnerability scanners malware flavors including root kits trojans back doors worms stenographic techniques Contract Software Developer Hexagon Safety June 2018 to March 2019 Worked on several versions of their Field Based Reporting product This is a clientserver architecture implemented with a WPF GUI and both Oracle and SQL Server databases in the backend My work consisted of making performance improvements and fixing bugs Senior Software Developer Elemental Scientific Instruments August 2017 to April 2018 Implemented N 1 motor calibration tool that vastly improved the time it took to calibrate all of the motors on the laser platform Implemented a WCF server that exposed our Laser methods to external users via a WCF Service This enabled some customers to interface with the laser from the Mass Spectrometer where they ran some experiments Made many performance improvements to the CUI especially significant when handling image data and video Implemented an extensible AddIn Framework into the GUI that enabled customers to add their own functionality to our platform The AddIn Framework was built upon Microsofts Managed Extensibility AddIn Framework architecture Contract Software Developer Medtronic September 2016 to February 2017

Quality Control This is a Click Once installed application Rewrote the data access component from ADONet to Entity Framework 63 Fixed production bugs and implemented functional enhancements as they arose Created version 20 of the Checkmark product which included a new product infrastructure which capitalized on the Factory design pattern so that new plants could be brought online quickly and their differences abstracted out of the core product code This also enabled us to have one set of source code across all plants versus one solution for each plant Implemented new plant location using proper WPFMVVM implementation for the GUI and Entity Framework interface to the data backend Integrated new hardware into the product which included a digital scales dial indicators and new barcode scanners Added log4net comprehensive logging to all versions of this product Used TFS for source code repository and code branches and merges Broker Price Opinion April 2014 to July 2014 Developing

Visual Studio 2013 using Net 451 I embrace Microsoft Best Practices methods and patterns SQL Server 2012 is the most common database back end DB component Ongoing computer security research and development Some key areas of exploration include common software and website exploitation techniques such as buffer overflows XSS cross site scripting SQL injection Developed proficiency with many offensive and defensive hacking tools including Metasploit Ares Backtrack3 etc as well as packet sniffers and crafters remote vulnerability scanners malware flavors including root kits trojans back doors worms stenographic techniques Contract Software Developer Hexagon Safety June 2018 to March 2019 Worked on several versions of their Field Based Reporting product This is a clientserver architecture implemented with a WPF GUI and both Oracle and SQL Server databases in the backend My work consisted of making performance improvements and fixing bugs Senior Software Developer Elemental Scientific Instruments August 2017 to April 2018 Implemented N 1 motor calibration tool that vastly improved the time it took to calibrate all of the motors on the laser platform Implemented a WCF server that exposed our Laser methods to external users via a WCF Service This enabled some customers to interface with the laser from the Mass Spectrometer where they ran some experiments Made many performance improvements to the CUI especially significant when handling image data and video Implemented an extensible AddIn Framework into the GUI that enabled customers to add their own functionality to our platform The AddIn Framework was built upon Microsofts Managed Extensibility AddIn Framework architecture Contract Software Developer Medtronic September 2016 to February 2017

Quality Control This is a Click Once installed application Rewrote the data access component from ADONet to Entity Framework 63 Fixed production bugs and implemented functional enhancements as they arose Created version 20 of the Checkmark product which included a new product infrastructure which capitalized on the Factory design pattern so that new plants could be brought online quickly and their differences abstracted out of the core product code This also enabled us to have one set of source code across all plants versus one solution for each plant Implemented new plant location using proper WPFMVVM implementation for the GUI and Entity Framework interface to the data backend Integrated new hardware into the product which included a digital scales dial indicators and new barcode scanners Added log4net comprehensive logging to all versions of this product Used TFS for source code repository and code branches and merges Broker Price Opinion April 2014 to July 2014 Developing
