SpiderNet to manage service providers wireless network SpiderNet manages FCAPS that consists of Service Nodes connected to Service Providers Verizon ATT etc Core and Radio Nodes connected to end users cell phones Service Nodes support features like SONs High availability redundancy feature On a failover we used virtual IPs to switch over the virtual IP to the other standby now active system so from a northbound user interface to the end usercustomer logging into the UI there was no change Even on southbound connections to the hundreds of devices EMS had to connect to and manage we created another southbound virtual IP so now for all the devices that are managed by EMS the devices also seamlessly use one virtual IP as the EMS server devices need to connect to The whole database including devices operational configuration performance security and user data was synched and replicated to the standby server immediately on a constant basis We have a secure protocol on boot up or failover to make sure only one of the EMS server takes the active state becomes the master and takes over the virtual IP addresses while the other EMS server in the pair takes on the secondary standby

part of the software also helps data center user their existing assets more efficiently The Analytics part of software would suggest which servers to retire not efficient consume too much power Optimization part of software will move applications and virtual machines to less used servers so some servers can be shutdown to save on electricity bill Company dissolved after 3 years Environment
