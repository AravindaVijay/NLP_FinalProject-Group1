exercise httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed2204 The addition of aerobic exercise AE to a resistance exercise RE program concurrent exercise CE can interfere with maximum muscle fiber growth achieved with RE Further CE appears to markedly affect the growth of myosin heavy chain MHC I but not MHC IIa fibers The mechanism responsible for this interference is unclear Satellite cell SC responsiveness to exercise appears to influence muscle adaptation but has not yet been examined following acute concurrent exercise Thus we assessed the fibertypespecific SC response to RE AE and CE exercise Eight collegeaged males completed the following two exercise trials the RE trial which consisted of unilateral leg extensions and presses 4 sets 10 repetitions 75 1 repetition maximum RM and the AECE trial which included an identical RE protocol with the opposite leg immediately followed by subjects cycling for 90 min 60 Wmax Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis before and 4 days after each session Samples were crosssectioned stained with antibodies against NCAM Ki67 and MHC I counterstained with DAPI and analyzed for SC density SC per fiber SC activation and fiber type SC density increased to a greater extent following RE 38 10 compared with CE 6 8 Similarly MHC I muscle fiber SC density displayed a greater increase following RE 46 14 compared with AE 7 17 and CE 8 8 Our data indicate that the SC response to RE is blunted when immediately followed by AE at least in MHC I muscle fibers and possibly MHC II fibers This suggests that the physiological environment evoked by AE might attenuate the eventual addition of myonuclei important for maximum muscle fiber growth and consequent forceproducing capacity",

exercise httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed22492813 201204 The addition of aerobic exercise AE to a resistance exercise RE program concurrent exercise CE can interfere with maximum muscle fiber growth achieved with RE Further CE appears to markedly affect the growth of myosin heavy chain MHC I but not MHC IIa fibers The mechanism responsible for this interference is unclear Satellite cell SC responsiveness to exercise appears to influence muscle adaptation but has not yet been examined following acute concurrent exercise Thus we assessed the fibertypespecific SC response to RE AE and CE exercise Eight collegeaged males completed the following two exercise trials the RE trial which consisted of unilateral leg extensions and presses 4 sets 10 repetitions 75 1 repetition maximum RM and the AECE trial which included an identical RE protocol with the opposite leg immediately followed by subjects cycling for 90 min 60 Wmax Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis before and 4 days after each session Samples were crosssectioned stained with antibodies against NCAM Ki67 and MHC I counterstained with DAPI and analyzed for SC density SC per fiber SC activation and fiber type SC density increased to a greater extent following RE 38 10 compared with CE 6 8 Similarly MHC I muscle fiber SC density displayed a greater increase following RE 46 14 compared with AE 7 17 and CE 8 8 Our data indicate that the SC response to RE is blunted when immediately followed by AE at least in MHC I muscle fibers and possibly MHC II fibers This suggests that the physiological environment evoked by AE might attenuate the eventual addition of myonuclei important for maximum muscle fiber growth and consequent forceproducing capacity",
