issues within current system and tuned certain trends and queries to have reports function properly and more quickly Identified system misconfigurations and provided fix actions for better system performance and reduced outages by over 50 Implemented ArcSight data broker Apache Kafka by Micro Focus Implemented ArcSight Load Balancing connector in an HA pair to round robin over 25K EPS across 5 different RHEL servers hosting 10 syslogng connectors that fed in to a event broker for data subscriptions for ESM and Elastic infrastructure Migrated old CONAPP appliances to use the new ArcMC ArcSight Management Center Tuned rules and data monitors to prevent excessive memory usage on existing system Tuned queries and filters that fed trends that exceeded high amounts of table space by reducing the sizes down from over 400GB to around 2030 GB while still having the required data fill the customers reports best practice is to not have trends exceed 1GB but in some cases on larger networks its hard to prevent that Designed new architecture for future growth to take advantage of the upcoming of ESMs new distributed correlation method and streamlining how the data gets from the source device to the ESM by reducing the amount of connectors needed while tuning map files to reduce stresss on certain connectors to prevent extreme data caching or service failure plan is still in the works as the newest ESM release is only beta stages Took current architecture and modified the CORR database to take full advantage of the 12TB from its current 1TB outfitting while also

support in the development of all new onboarding programs with detailed documentation and tracks progression of the procedures relevant to the task Accustomed to constructing a pathway for data ingestion through one way transfer solutions between enclaves such as data being ingested into an Elastic Stack for federal auditing regulations Accomplishments Determined and mitigated CORR database issues within current system and tuned certain trends and queries to have reports function properly and more quickly Identified system misconfigurations and provided fix actions for better system performance and reduced outages by over 50 Implemented ArcSight data broker Apache Kafka by Micro Focus Implemented ArcSight Load Balancing connector in an HA pair to round robin over 25K EPS across 5 different RHEL servers hosting 10 syslogng connectors that fed in to a event broker for data subscriptions for ESM and Elastic infrastructure Migrated old CONAPP appliances to use the new ArcMC ArcSight Management Center Tuned rules and data monitors to prevent excessive memory usage on existing system Tuned queries and filters that fed trends that exceeded high amounts of table space by reducing the sizes down from over 400GB to around 2030 GB while still having the required data fill the customers reports best practice is to not have trends exceed 1GB but in some cases on larger networks its hard to prevent that Designed new architecture for future growth to take advantage of the upcoming of ESMs new distributed correlation method and streamlining how the data gets from the source device to the ESM by reducing the amount of connectors needed while tuning map files to reduce stresss on certain connectors to prevent extreme data caching or service failure plan is still in the works as the newest ESM release is only beta stages Took current architecture and modified the CORR database to take full advantage of the 12TB from its current 1TB outfitting while also
