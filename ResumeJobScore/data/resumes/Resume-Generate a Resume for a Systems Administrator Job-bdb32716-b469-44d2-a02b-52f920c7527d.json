major player in European tourism They have low cost airline services and a chain of hotels all over the world Their booking system runs on their customized transaction processing TP system called MONITOR MONITOR is a Transaction Processing System that has facilities similar to IBM CICS and IBM TPF It has mixed features from both of these TP systems The database used in MONITOR is called FMFT is very similar to TPFDF of IBM TPF The central booking system TRACS is the name of the application that runs on MONITOR TP System This is mainly a reservation system for flights and hotels TRACS is connected to a NEONSOFTs SWS web server on mainframe and other java transaction servers mainly on WLS Weblogic server via middleware messaging viz MQSeries Every availability booking cancellation request is sent to MQ The TP system picks these queries from MQ and the results are put again in MQ The data exchange between the client system and the MONITOR TP is in various formats including XML and FAX format Travel agents can book the hotel and flight tickets from a CICS like VTAM terminal while customers can directly book on the net Responsibilities Understanding the design document and making code changes in the availability search booking and reporting modules of TRACS Maintaining test harness for each developer As each developer had his own test harness selected data needed to be

use Submit Buttons Radio Buttons clicks on links etc The rich functionality of a browser IE 8 takes over the limitations of the small screens on the telnet sessions Openspan Inc provides a tool called Openspan Integrator which scrapes the Telnet 3270 screens into XML and puts them into IBM MQ server The web application is always monitoring the MQ for any new http requests The backend application is written in java it reads the XML message in MQ and transforms it into java objects and a corresponding web page is presented to the user The application then waits for users response Once it receives users response it again puts a message in another queue for Openspan integrator to mimic Function Keys F1 F2 F3 etc on the telnet 3270 emulator Responsibilities Developing Openspan Integrators to generate XMLs from mainframe screens Writing classes for unmarshalling the Openspan XMLs Created UI in Spring MVC and JQuery Used JMS and Spring in conjunction for integrating Openspan with Websphere

Description TUI Touristic Union International UK also known as Thomson Tours is a major player in European tourism They have low cost airline services and a chain of hotels all over the world Their booking system runs on their customized transaction processing TP system called MONITOR MONITOR is a Transaction Processing System that has facilities similar to IBM CICS and IBM TPF It has mixed features from both of these TP systems The database used in MONITOR is called FMFT is very similar to TPFDF of IBM TPF The central booking system TRACS is the name of the application that runs on MONITOR TP System This is mainly a reservation system for flights and hotels TRACS is connected to a NEONSOFTs SWS web server on mainframe and other java transaction servers mainly on WLS Weblogic server via middleware messaging viz MQSeries Every availability booking cancellation request is sent to MQ The TP system picks these queries from MQ and the results are put again in MQ The data exchange between the client system and the MONITOR TP is in various formats including XML and FAX format Travel agents can book the hotel and flight tickets from a CICS like VTAM terminal while customers can directly book on the net Responsibilities Understanding the design document and making code changes in the availability search booking and reporting modules of TRACS Maintaining test
