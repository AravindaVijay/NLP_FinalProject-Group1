Managing cross functional cross vendor development interfacing with customers Building teams mentoring team members Managing offshore teams Accomplishments Instrumental in building first generation Blu ray players Led development of BD J stack which was one of the most complex piece of software in Blu ray player Led architecture and development of platform software for Nucleus middleware for Seachange managed large teams spanning multiple projects Helped architect and develop high performance software for set top platform on a very tight deadline Responsible for representing Pioneer technically as a CE industry member in OCAP specification group and suggesting fundamental changes to spec to satisfy needs of CE industries in cable market Developed excitation control system for alternators built complete hardware and software for the product Experience Engineering Manager November 2010 to May 2016 Company Name City State Managing multiple work streams and teams related to platform software development for set top boxes Interacting with customers vendors and multiple cross functional groups Managing product development and supporting deployment of products Evangelized and led development of new middleware solution for OTT and other multimedia playback on set tops The middleware is being designed for a very responsive user experience minimum copy transfer of buffers along playback record pipelines high performance playback of multiple contents in several video windows and content security The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server Led a team for developing cutting edge platform software solution for set top box for MSOs The software has several features like HTML5 UI with webkit QT home networking DVR content protection DRM and playback on 2nd screens like iPads etc Software is deployed on a Broadcom SoC with Liberty Global in Poland and Czech republic Worked on EOS flavor of this product which is going to be deployed in some countries in Europe by end of this year Worked on optimizing the stack for low latency wrt resource management and channel changes Also worked on leading a team of developers towards development of software components for headless gateway product for home networking with new Intel Chipsets The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server Led a group towards porting of Comcast RDK platform on ST Micro SoCs for set tops Led a group towards porting development of software for RDK platform for RNG150 Comcast platforms Engineering Manager Architect January 2004 to November 2010 Company Name City State Worked on development of technologies in the field of consumer electronics Led a team of engineers towards development of BD J stack for Blu ray Players Wrote initial code for some core modules like file system and application management led the development of other modules for the stack security framework JMF and Java TV subsystem interactive audio graphics subsystem based on AWT HAVi and DVB extensions and all other BDJ specific modules Led the efforts on all certifications required for BD J JAVA BD BD J APIs Worked on supporting the product in market after shipment Played critical role in development and architecture of OCAP middleware the technology was later sold to a third party Contributed to specification group for OCAP Worked on architecture of application framework security framework and file system and some other modules architected and wrote the code for most complex component of OCAP DSM CC file system Development of Advanced Media Player this media player had a Blu ray player at its core and other network enhanced functionality for video playback music photo management for local and remote content this had music recommendation features on client device with the help of remote server in cloud Also worked on architecture for making closed and open source code co exist within the same system The

Managing cross functional cross vendor development interfacing with customers Building teams mentoring team members Managing offshore teams Accomplishments Instrumental in building first generation Blu ray players Led development of BD J stack which was one of the most complex piece of software in Blu ray player Led architecture and development of platform software for Nucleus middleware for Seachange managed large teams spanning multiple projects Helped architect and develop high performance software for set top platform on a very tight deadline Responsible for representing Pioneer technically as a CE industry member in OCAP specification group and suggesting fundamental changes to spec to satisfy needs of CE industries in cable market Developed excitation control system for alternators built complete hardware and software for the product Experience Engineering Manager November 2010 to May 2016 Company Name City State Managing multiple work streams and teams related to platform software development for set top boxes Interacting with customers vendors and multiple cross functional groups Managing product development and supporting deployment of products Evangelized and led development of new middleware solution for OTT and other multimedia playback on set tops The middleware is being designed for a very responsive user experience minimum copy transfer of buffers along playback record pipelines high performance playback of multiple contents in several video windows and content security The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server Led a team for developing cutting edge platform software solution for set top box for MSOs The software has several features like HTML5 UI with webkit QT home networking DVR content protection DRM and playback on 2nd screens like iPads etc Software is deployed on a Broadcom SoC with Liberty Global in Poland and Czech republic Worked on EOS flavor of this product which is going to be deployed in some countries in Europe by end of this year Worked on optimizing the stack for low latency wrt resource management and channel changes Also worked on leading a team of developers towards development of software components for headless gateway product for home networking with new Intel Chipsets The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server Led a group towards porting of Comcast RDK platform on ST Micro SoCs for set tops Led a group towards porting development of software for RDK platform for RNG150 Comcast platforms Engineering Manager Architect January 2004 to November 2010 Company Name City State Worked on development of technologies in the field of consumer electronics Led a team of engineers towards development of BD J stack for Blu ray Players Wrote initial code for some core modules like file system and application management led the development of other modules for the stack security framework JMF and Java TV subsystem interactive audio graphics subsystem based on AWT HAVi and DVB extensions and all other BDJ specific modules Led the efforts on all certifications required for BD J JAVA BD BD J APIs Worked on supporting the product in market after shipment Played critical role in development and architecture of OCAP middleware the technology was later sold to a third party Contributed to specification group for OCAP Worked on architecture of application framework security framework and file system and some other modules architected and wrote the code for most complex component of OCAP DSM CC file system Development of Advanced Media Player this media player had a Blu ray player at its core and other network enhanced functionality for video playback music photo management for local and remote content this had music recommendation features on client device with the help of remote server in cloud Also worked on architecture for making closed and open source code co exist within the same system The media player was modeled as being driven by Restful JSON APIs Senior Software Engineer April 2000 to January 2004 Company Name City State Worked towards development of various technologies related to
