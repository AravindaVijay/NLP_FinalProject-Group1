Java Developer Ulta Beauty Chicago IL February 2019 to Present Responsibilities Actively involved in Analysis Design Development System Testing and User Acceptance Testing Involved in the development using JavaJ2EE Technologies Web Services and Hibernate ORM Framework Designed and developed Microservices using REST framework and Spring Boot in creating the Application Used Java8 features in developing the code like creating resource classes fetching documents from database Extensively used MVC Factory the Singleton design patterns Implemented the application using SpringBoot Framework and handled the security using Spring Security Used Spring Boot which is radically faster in building cloud Microservices and develop spring based application with very less configuration Used Spring framework to provide loose coupling between different application modules Developed Hibernate with Spring Integration as the data abstraction to interact with the database of MongoDB Used Microservices to communicate using synchronous protocols HTTP and REST for implementing SOA Worked with NoSQL database Mongo DB and worked with it to perform many different operations Used Cassandra for achieving denormalization through features like collections Developed unit tests with JUNIT and Mockito Developed build tasks to run the unit tests on Jenkins and maintaining separate build in Maven for the module for easy integration to the portal build and configure with Jenkins Worked closely with QA team and fixed QA bugs with a quick turnaround time Focused on Test Driven Development thereby creating detailed Unit tests for every single piece of functionality before actually writing the functionality Used Apache Maven for project management and building the application Environment
