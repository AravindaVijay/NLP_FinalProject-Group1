development and SEO as I have almost 10 years of experience in these fields Ive been developing databasedriven CMS websites since 2007 and have SEO skills as well Website security is also a strong suit in my web development skill set I have 21 years of experience in the print industry beginning with graphic designgloss covers in 1998 and moving through the workflow to begin the implementation of a digital commercial workflow strategy for CSI Media by 2000 This included installing and maintaining 22 Macintosh computers their Adobe Suites and maintaining a competitive edge with our designprepress department My workflow eventually migrated to support commercial print with responsibilities including Customer Service client software training assisting customer in properly building
