Adapter during the development of components Developed and deployed Action Classes and JSP for Dynamic HTML generation Developed SOAP web services utilizing business logic for CRUD functionality and Rest Easy web services for creating reports and tested using SOAP UI Implemented stateless session beans in business processing layer Used GWT for compiling code written in JAVA to JavaScript code write clientside application Used XML parser APIs such as JAXP and JAXB in the web services request response data marshalling as well as Unmarshalling process Implemented Graphical User Interface using JSP HTML JSTL CSS JavaScript Implemented DAO layer and mapped data base tables with Hibernate Entities using annotations Created inheritance mapping and integrated with Hibernate template method calls Developed reports in Perl for the end users Used Custom nodejs proxy used to simulate API responses before client implementation Develop the Perl and Shell scripts to automate the finance billing file Implemented Spring ORM for data persistence support for Hibernate Built and edited SpringHibernate configuration file for subprojects Used SOAPUI for JAXWS and JAXWS API for creating XMLbased web services Involved in writing CSS scripts and JAVA Scripts Worked on Groovy Support with Quark framework Used spring JDBC to connect database for web services Worked On Test Driven

internal purposes One among the application is Member Touchpoint Measures MTM This application is used for internal auditing purpose The audits are performed and the data is entered into this application This application also provides the facility to generate reports out of the data populated The final score will be calculated from the application and will be sent out to the BCBSA association on the monthly basis which is a mandate for WellPoint There are some scheduled jobs as well that sends out reports to the metrics team Responsibilities Responsible for design and development of Web Application using Struts Framework and written Action Classes Form Bean Classes and configure the Application using Struts Configuration file Did technical design to conform to STRUTS MVC framework Wrote serverside programs by using Servlets and JSP Designed and developed the HTML front end screens and validated forms using JavaScript Made use of almost all ObjectOriented concepts like Inheritance polymorphism and Abstraction Application and user level configurations have been maintained by using XML Files Implemented MVC using Struts Framework Utilized Servlets to handle various requests from the client browser and send responses Created and implemented PLSQL stored procedures triggers Designing and documenting of the stored procedures Coding Test Classes using
