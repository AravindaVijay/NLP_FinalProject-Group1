Vienna VA July 2010 to August 2013 Description This project is about comprehensive and integrated Hospital Management System for a Super Specialty Hospital This package is used to computerize the activities of a servicing system This package contains four modules development configuration management and quality assurance plans coding to meet requirement specifications developing and maintaining development artifacts eg design documentation use case diagrams Requires Demonstrable handson experience integrating commercial and opensource products handson experience using integrated development environments continuous integration tools and handson experience developing webbased applications using a number of Java and related languages and frameworks with technologies They are Administration Patient Care System Health Services and Auxiliary Services Each module is having sub modules with in this sub modules will maintain storing registering details of joining patient details and over all day activities maintains one database Responsibilities Used the Agile methodology to develop the application Coordinated the activities between onshore and offshore Collaborate closely with business owners users project managers requirements analysts testers and other stakeholders in the software development process Middle tier development using Java in a J2EE environment Experience in Developing GUIs using Eclipse RCPSWT and Core Java Design patterns Developed the presentation layer written using JSP HTML CSS and clientside validations were done using JavaScript and jQuery Developing webtier using struts framework Used XML Http Request Object to provide asynchronous communication as part of AJAX implementation Developed ORM mappings using Hibernate annotations and also established data integrity among all tables sitting on Oracle Database Used IBM WebSphere and JBoss as the Application Servers Used Java Messaging Services JMS for reliable and asynchronous exchange of important information such as payment status report Estimate effort for completing new features enhancements and defect fixes Participate in design review and code review activities of the
