2018 to Present IoT IPCCTV PACS Contract Dec 2018 Dec 2019 Installed and configured Milestone XProtect software in standalone and custom mode defined by site Built a virtual lab environment to test the script based automated install of Milestone XProtect software and its components consisting of one Domain Controller one Milestone Management Server one Milestone Event Server one Microsoft SQL Server Express running as a separate instance on its own server and one Milestone Recording Server PowerShell scripts I created were utilized to perform the automation tasks All servers run Windows Server 2016 Adhering consistency I created various forms utilizing a Single Payne of Glass approach to streamline and facilitate collaboration between various teams involved with the project The submitter submits the form which is used by each team to complete their task using the information contained within the form Once the team completes their task updates the form and returns it back to the submitter the submitter submits the form to the next team until all the fields and the tasks within the form have been completed Collaborated with various teams including the DDI DNS DHCP and IPAM team storage team VMWare team Windows Server team Symantec Endpoint team SQL team Account Provisioning team Platform Engineering Operations team and onsite personnel throughout the migration process in order to obtain static IPs storage disks virtual machines server certifications SQL 2016 software installation and configuration Symantec exclusions Active Directory security groups and organizational units and usernames and workstation hostnames so that the workstations will be entitled by the Platform Operations team and install the Milestone software client Designed developed tested and executed various PowerShell scripts to interface with the AXIS API to configure and collect data that cannot be completed within the Axis Device Manager that elsewise would have been completed manually by hand The scripts enabled bulk functions to be performed on bulk camera devices Designed developed tested and executed various PowerShell scripts to interface with the Milestone
