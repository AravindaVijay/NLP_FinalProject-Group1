the companys nationwide IT operations To protect the company against ransomware such as WannaCry that are based on SMBv1 a Group Policy Object was defined to disable SMBv1 using Microsofts suggested Registry keys Prepared Computer Incident Response reports whenever a machine was suspected of compromise Investigation Reviewing Windows event logs web browser plugins browsing history on the client and within the Meraki console and AddRemove Programs Remediation For adware cleaning scans with Symantec EndPoint and MalwareBytes were conducted For critical infections such as ransomware or trojans the machine was immediately quarantined and replaced In cases of an incident at a remote office the machines network connection can be disabled from within the Meraki Prevention Blacklisting of suspicious websites within the Meraki console for all offices and research of additional proactive measures as was done with WannaCry Transitioned from Barracuda 410 to Cisco Meraki content filtering The rules are maintained daily through subscription updates and supplemented with manually created rules Internet access is presently restricted based upon machine name and through AD user account integration To more closely safeguard company data against theft GPOs were composed to block writing to USB thumb drives based upon user membership in an Active Directory group and to automatically

Processing Built HP ProLiant servers with Windows 2008 R2 for roles such as Domain Controller Print Server RDS Remote Desktop Services File server roles for the NY main office Prepared HP servers for similar functions including HyperV virtualized RDS roles for numerous remote offices Chicago Toronto New Jersey Miami and Los Angeles To improve performance and redundancy several antiquated Domain Controllers were replaced with new servers This entailed utilizing DCPromo to prepare the replacement Domain Controller at a remote site with the old Domain Controller later demoted via DCPromo DCDiag i q was utilized to check for errors and replication was forced from the NY headquarters Domain Controllers via AD Sites and Services Continuously participate in a project to test virtual machine or data replication between two geographically disparate locations so as to maintain continuous uptime of a custom ESRI mapping portal This required seeding the replicas with Initial Replication or restored virtual machines and assignment of custom logical nics and individual processors to guest virtual machines Shadow Copies are enabled on all file servers to complement the slower tape backups With the twice daily frequency of captured file versions we have had to restore from tape backups only once in the past year Business downtime decreased from hours to minutes On RDS servers management tasks including installation of applications using Change User install for RDSaware installation mode CAL licensing and Host Configuration set to terminate disconnected sessions after several hours Support has involved use of Remote Desktop Services Manager or the command line to shadow logged on user sessions To reduce resource needs a physical 2008 R2 RDS server was virtualized with VMware vCenter Converter and migrated with several HyperV virtual machines to VMware ESXi 60 and managed with version 650 of vServer A second host was built with ESXi 650 to temporarily migrate the vms onto so that the 60 host could be updated via SSH Exchange Discovery reports are generated and the results exported when requested by the firms Legal counsel PowerShell is used to prohibit Exchange 2013s
