condition even when working under pressure Work Experience Oracle Developer Csaac Organization Gaithersburg MD January 2017 to Present Rewrote and implemented a backup strategy following company SLA execution of backup schedule for both physical and logical backups using RMAN and DATAPUMP utilities respectively I also used block change tracking BCT which reduced backup time from 8hrs down to 45mins Deployed Database security policy and installation using passwords privileges and user profiles Used Oracle Transparent Data Encryption to encrypt columns tables and Tablespaces I also implemented the triple A AAA and database auditing policies as well as data redaction Managed database security by creating assigning appropriate roles privileges to users depending on user activity

condition even when working under pressure Work Experience Oracle Developer Csaac Organization Gaithersburg MD January 2017 to Present Rewrote and implemented a backup strategy following company SLA execution of backup schedule for both physical and logical backups using RMAN and DATAPUMP utilities respectively I also used block change tracking BCT which reduced backup time from 8hrs down to 45mins Deployed Database security policy and installation using passwords privileges and user profiles Used Oracle Transparent Data Encryption to encrypt columns tables and Tablespaces I also implemented the triple A AAA and database auditing policies as well as data redaction Managed database security by creating assigning appropriate roles privileges to users depending on user activity auditing performing other security related tasks including Transparent Data Encryption Cloned databases using RMAN and DATAPUMP utilities for all database sizes Extensively used AWR ADDM ASH and Explain plan for periodic Performance tuning Monitored AWR ADDM ASH Alert log dynamic performance views DBMS_STATS Trace Files System Event Logs for unusual events took appropriate action according to company policies of incident reports Experience migrating database objects from development through test into production environments Capacity planning supported 3 tier architecture planning of tables indexes tablespaces and databases to allow for growth potential and analyze data growth trends for capacity and resources Installed and administered Oracle Physical Standby Database for single and multiple instances to achieve high availability and DR solution DATA GUARD Capacity planning to meet the demands of the dynamic aspects of storage memory for the databases Performed database Refreshes from production environments Implement table and index partitioning so as to Minimize DB time increase disk load balancing improve query speed and enable faster parallel query Senior Database
