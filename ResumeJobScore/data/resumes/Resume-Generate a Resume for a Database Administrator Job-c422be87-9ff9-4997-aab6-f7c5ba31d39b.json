to configure the product Also helped produced a Software Development Plan and an Interface Requirements Specification and review the Software Requirements Document Applications Architect EDSI Falls Church VA March 2008 to November 2013 Converted a ProC application to Java SE 6 application utilized vectors file IO system calls to the SCP command line utility and methods for reformatting flat ascii files utilized NetBeans and standard JDK library Converted a VB6 MAPI application to a Java Web Services Client utilized Maven to test and build JAR module Git to maintain versions JUnit to create and perform automated tests log4j to update logs IntelliJ community version IDE to develop code utilized spring dependency injection and standard JDK libraries JAXB to marshal Microsoft Exchange schemas interfaced with a Microsoft Exchange Server to process inbound and outbound email message traffic and convert the body of the SOAP messages to flat ascii files Maintained complex Bourne shell scripts which transferred the ascii flat files generated by the client over a cross domain solution Guard which was bidirectional Maintained a ProC application for parsing the ascii flat files from the cross domain solution into an Oracle 11g database which called stored procedures and utilized embedded SQL statements along with C language code to process inbound flat ascii files and parse the data in the files into appropriate staging tables where another process again a ProC application would put the data from the staging tables into the designated tables so it could be utilized

data and new data for the procedures to use using Oracle command line Loader utility and shell scripts Created Procedures Functions and Packages to manipulate data using SQL functions within the code such as trunk round substring etc Converted all Procedures to dynamically run and created the SQL statements on the fly with execute immediate statements Produced CSV files SQL Navigator and SQL statements from data tables which could be loaded into excel spreadsheets Senior Software Tester MSGI CORPORATION Falls Church VA March 2006 to June 2006 Performed functional technical and adhoc
