WebSphere Process Server Websphere Business Monitor Java Developer MCI Ashburn VA February 2008 to March 2010 The Access Optimization AO project has been implemented by ACELA to integrate several of Verizons Networks provisioning systems like NetPro FE Cameo etc The Access Optimization application accepts orders from NetPro FE and COMS stores the order in the ICS transient database and then interacts with The CAMEO application which determine the optimal path to provision the order During the determination of the optimal path CAMEO invokes the CFA Validation routine of the AO application The CFA Validation routine in turn interacts with FE NetPro TCOMS and Symphony to determine circuit availability The Symphony application to do LEC Address Validation Once A B are complete the AO application returns the processed order information back to the originating system AO application also processes requests from the PSG to do Path Selection CFA Validation and LEC Address Validation These interfaces have been developed using WebSphere Business Integration WBI Interchange Server ICS It includes development of Business Objects Data Handlers Maps Collaboration and configuring connectors relationships and Database Connection Pools Responsibilities A new interface between Acela and IMPACT was developed IMPACT will provide a web service that will allow Acela to notify it to start and stop monitoring of a circuit Acela will utilize the Web services adapter to communicate with IMPACT Modified interface between Acela and FE This Receives FE requests to update FE circuit segments in NetPro CSDB Circuit Segment Database Built UNIX scripts to monitor each instance of ICS which check if ICS process is running application adapters are running and bring them up if they are down Responsible for developing complex SQL queries for ICS Core Designed and Developed the Collaboration flow for each interface Performance tuning of interfaces developed by other development teams
