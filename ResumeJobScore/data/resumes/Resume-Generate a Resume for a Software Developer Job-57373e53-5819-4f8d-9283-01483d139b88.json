Experience Network SystemServer Administrator DOUBLE BRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES INC Princeton NJ January 2018 to Present Identify errors for CPU configuration by checking BMC System Event Log to confirm if mainboard needs to perform a replacement Verify DIMM failure the error could be located by executing SEL Log and MCE log then replace related memory if memory lost needs to confirm it could be found in BIOS after the replacement the mainboard andor CPU is required to be replaced in order if data cannot be retrieved after replacement of memory Analyze root cause of hard disk failure perform changing of hard disk based on SOP if speed down analyze routed chain and replace parts in order then check IsscsiIspci to confirm if lost perform hard disk replacement after collecting slot position Perform checking issue of cooling exhaust fan if speed down update PIC FWCM4 FW and BMC FW perform chain routed check and replace parts if speed still down if stop working verify if its wellinserted and if the fan needs to be replaced if issue still exists perform checking chain routed then replace parts in order till exhausted fan work as normal Verify the reason that server down check log to identify if its related to mainboard if yes analyze further if its related to FW update FW if not proceed to replace mainboard If no proceed to replace Identify root cause of PSU abnormal performance if power lost check whether its related to loose of power line or dead of battery if LED displays orange change battery if error occurred check BMC log and analyze chain routed in order till PSU works normal Computer Systems Engineer DoubleBridge Technologies Inc March 2017 to Present Pfizer ACD project Responsible for collecting requirements from stake holder based on Pfizer Acquisition Collaboration and Divesture projects Draft project strategy and create Business Analytic Property Enrichment Template BAPET for documents that need to be uploaded updated within Pfizer system Cooperate with technical team or business operators for bulking upload update based on generated BAPET Analyze and discussion with related technicians in case of any unexpected scenarios raised up Pfizer Automation project Responsible for analyzing and recognizing currently manual process that could be simplified if Robotic Process Automation RPA applied Cooperate with Project Manager and initiate the proposed flowchart Research the RPA realization process details and estimate the amount of time savings against manual Work with development team about the functionalities realization Pfizer Business Support project Responsible for statistics of monthly helpdesk inscope tickets and analyze the reason for the increasing or decreasing of volume if any Report influence of big event that includes system new release change request deployment and bug fix Inform team of recent work instruction updates if any through weekly based meeting User Acceptance Tester July 2016 to March 2017 Responsible for manually executing testing scripts for Pfizer Quality Management System project through the Application called HP ALMQC Quality Center Draft test strategy and test scripts for Pfizer

2016 Remote Controlling a Car Over the Smartphone and Raspberry Pi Programmed Python codes and searched references online to learn how to use smart phone to control the model car remotely Connected a camera module for Raspberry Pi 2 and used WinSCP to transfer the file from PC to Raspberry Pi 2 Used VLC media player to watch the realtime situation when the car was moving using L298N HBridge being a motor driver module Currency Exchange Rate Prediction Using BP Neural Network Developed the back propagation algorithm and implemented it by MATLAB R2013b Used statistic from website wwwinvestingcom
