expectations I went with 1 vendor for all of these 10 products10 immediate discount on all products and 1025 on certain items FiberTech is their top priority prior to this the account representative

insurance rating was a 4 when I got hired and I got it down to a 3 Considering the industry and how many plant employees come and go that was a big win I got it lowered by jumping into the

FiberTech actually does for the plant employees I had a 401K meeting that was successful I made it known that my office was open I would answer any question they had and I also gave them all a copy of the new handbook and I made a game out of it because money motivates many people The attiude of the company doesnt offer good benefits etc turned to the company offers a lot and yes they are on our
