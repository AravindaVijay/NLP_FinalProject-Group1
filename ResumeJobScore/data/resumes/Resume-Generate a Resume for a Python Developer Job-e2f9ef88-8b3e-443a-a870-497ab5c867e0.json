Present Led Software Engineers to create custom Visual Studios 2013 and 2017 Web applications to integrate with customers databases and Web API using Windows 10 C 70 with NET 45Provide technical expertise to the customer on the deployment and application related issues Developed C Web application for Ford Motor Company to integrate with their data source Created a rich and responsive UI with live updates from external Web API Implemented a robust error handling scheme to handle abnormalities and error exceptions Created custom Web API that interfaces with the HotDocs services to auto generate reports without conducting an interview The Web API accpects a POST request and consumes a JSON answer package and template name as part of the body The application then generates a report in PDF and saved to a desired location DevOps Created published and deployed custom Web Applications Interfaced with customer and resolved defects found Performed all QA regression testing SW Configuration Management Managed quality of the SW using the features in Bitbucket such branching and pull requests Full Stack Software Engineer Developed MVC and Web API applications that interfaces to a SQL database and other date sources Mentored Technical Consultants US and aboard Collaborated with Product Owners and Managers on resource allocations and delivery schedules Wrote Technical Design Documents on product deliverables Software Engineer Hologic Incorporated San Diego CA 2015 to 2018 Developed and maintained SW on PantherFusion diagnostics instrument using Windows 10 C 71 with NET 471 Created tools to validate test and process Assays files to ensure reliability on the instrument and other various forms of applications With a multithreading application on Panther created software to detect a thread deadlock Once identified the application locates thread and reports the deadlock The information time stack trace and other meta data is recorded in a file to be used for investigation Developed an automated testing framework software to test current and new assays for IT and UIT Devised a strategy to store expected data in an XML serialized the file into an object to be used to compare with actual processed results Recorded passfail outcomes to file and collect objective evidence OE The results were a reduction in the number of lines of code reusability rapid development and time saved to collect OE from days to seconds Localization expert Addressed Panther UI and Assay reporting RDLC defects Worked with external translators to resolve defected and new strings Managed all localized strings on Panther Collaborated with other engineers in order to reduce translation cost The results were a 65000 reduction from the initial bid Maintained Quality Control tool to support current and new assay Created new code by decoupling each assays into new classes Developed new IT code to test requirements and code The outcome was backwards compatibility of past assays high reliability no SW exceptions quick development cycle for new assays Full Stack Software Engineer Visual Studios 2013 to 2017 2013 and 2017 Web applications to integrate with customers

Present Led Software Engineers to create custom Visual Studios 2013 and 2017 Web applications to integrate with customers databases and Web API using Windows 10 C 70 with NET 45Provide technical expertise to the customer on the deployment and application related issues Developed C Web application for Ford Motor Company to integrate with their data source Created a rich and responsive UI with live updates from external Web API Implemented a robust error handling scheme to handle abnormalities and error exceptions Created custom Web API that interfaces with the HotDocs services to auto generate reports without conducting an interview The Web API accpects a POST request and consumes a JSON answer package and template name as part of the body The application then generates a report in PDF and saved to a desired location DevOps Created published and deployed custom Web Applications Interfaced with customer and resolved defects found Performed all QA regression testing SW Configuration Management Managed quality of the SW using the features in Bitbucket such branching and pull requests Full Stack Software Engineer Developed MVC and Web API applications that interfaces to a SQL database and other date sources Mentored Technical Consultants US and aboard Collaborated with Product Owners and Managers on resource allocations and delivery schedules Wrote Technical Design Documents on product deliverables Software Engineer Hologic Incorporated San Diego CA 2015 to 2018 Developed and maintained SW on PantherFusion diagnostics instrument using Windows 10 C 71 with NET 471 Created tools to validate test and process Assays files to ensure reliability on the instrument and other various forms of applications With a multithreading application on Panther created software to detect a thread deadlock Once identified the application locates thread and reports the deadlock The information time stack trace and other meta data is recorded in a file to be used for investigation Developed an automated testing framework software to test current and new assays for IT and UIT Devised a strategy to store expected data in an XML serialized the file into an object to be used to compare with actual processed results Recorded passfail outcomes to file and collect objective evidence OE The results were a reduction in the number of lines of code reusability rapid development and time saved to collect OE from days to seconds Localization expert Addressed Panther UI and Assay reporting RDLC defects Worked with external translators to resolve defected and new strings Managed all localized strings on Panther Collaborated with other engineers in order to reduce translation cost The results were a 65000 reduction from the initial bid Maintained Quality Control tool to support current and new assay Created new code by decoupling each assays into new classes Developed new IT code to test requirements and code The outcome was backwards compatibility of past assays high reliability no SW exceptions quick development cycle for new assays Full Stack Software Engineer Visual Studios 2013 to 2017 2013 and 2017 Web applications to integrate with customers
