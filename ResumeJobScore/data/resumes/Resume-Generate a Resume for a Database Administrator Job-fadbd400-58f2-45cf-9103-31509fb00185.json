authentication system by creating many security questions in the system and maintain the password secure using Java application We focus only on what you know type authentication We propose our Inferred Password Authentication System IPAS is similar to the pass point scheme with some finer differences In IPAS We consider the password as a piece of information known to the server at the time of registration and at the time of authentication the user give this information in an inferred form that can be understood only by the server The main aim of the project is to maintain the security of the password the security questions will be asked to maintain the password security It keeps the system safe and protects the password by hacking by others and keeps the data protected from the

authentication system by creating many security questions in the system and maintain the password secure using Java application We focus only on what you know type authentication We propose our Inferred Password Authentication System IPAS is similar to the pass point scheme with some finer differences In IPAS We consider the password as a piece of information known to the server at the time of registration and at the time of authentication the user give this information in an inferred form that can be understood only by the server The main aim of the project is to maintain the security of the password the security questions will be asked to maintain the password security It keeps the system safe and protects the password by hacking by others and keeps the data protected from the
