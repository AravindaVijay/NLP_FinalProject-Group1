application that was built using laravel to provide a platform to have agencys or individuals be able to manage content and deploy it to many social media platforms I joined the team to help develop new features including being able to post content to twitter tumblr facebook I designed the database architectureto support this scaling data to store all the oAuth keys and codes while allowing for flexibility to add more platforms I also designed a system to connection to 3rd party platforms like google drive to import content into the platform I used google drives api to display all the files that are able to be imported display them in a list and allow a user to check them one by one or with a select all button which then triggers an import process that will import this data into the system I also built an upload content feature that allows you to upload content with either a drag and drop or button that would trigger an upload to import your content into the system that would allow you to deploy this content to any of the social media platforms you have connected to the system I also develop a client content review system that allows agencies to create write content then invite their clients to review the document via email This setup an invite key that validates the link when their client clicks it and also either auto creates them an account or logs them back in toa previous created account for a seamless transition This allows the client not to get bogged down with signup or registration forms This link also stays active until the document is published Technical

they can from the CSV import if there happens to be a tweak that is needed We built several reporting features like missing payment audits which will take a customer and look at the past 12 months and see what payments they havent received payments for yet A huge feature was the ability to have agents be able to login and run reports manage there subscribers and also check for missing payments all from there own personalized portal This whole system is also white label enabled so we can brand the system with their logos and a couple primary and secondary colors to skin the portal This application makes use of many laravel features including the batch cron jobs to process the massive CSV imports from the customers This application was designed from the ground up based on wireframe I developed from balsamiq that was taken from the customers businesss current process they had in place using excel to do all of this manually I designed the database structure relationships and
