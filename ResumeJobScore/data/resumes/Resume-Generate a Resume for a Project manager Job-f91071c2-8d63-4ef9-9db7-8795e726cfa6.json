2012 Developed software in python interfaced with oracle database to query and update calibration constants for close to a million detector readout channels Developed python packages to understand performance of detector and monitor environment parameters like temperature humidity This package also generated alarms when environment variables were out of acceptable range and automatically sent emails to experts Analyzed data to look for quark compositeness conjectured to be the most fundamental building block of matter not yet been discovered experimentally Developed software package mostly in C python and linux shell script to analyze dataset containing over 2 billion entries and each entry containing over 50 objects and each objects having over few 10s of variables Developed criteria to select signal events entries of interest in the dataset over background non interesting processes that mimic the signal We have used several statistical technics including KolmogorovSmirnov test multivariate techniques Also developed software packages to run Monte Carlo simulation to model background and tune analysis requirements on signal Wrote software in C that was interfaced with specialized statistical analysis package called root for putting 95 confidence level limit on the process using Bayesian technic Extensively used STL Standard Template Library in particular vectors
