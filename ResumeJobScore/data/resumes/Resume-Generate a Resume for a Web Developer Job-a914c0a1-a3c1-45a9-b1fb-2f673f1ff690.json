phases of the project with major emphasis on Development of the modules like Activations Customer Service Developed various J2EE components like Servlets JSP JNDI Used SpringMVC framework to enable the interactions between JSPView layer and implemented different design patterns with J2EE and XML technology Data Operations were performed using Spring ORM wiring with Hibernate and Implemented Hibernate Template and criteria API for Querying database Implemented the persistence layer using Hibernate and configured Hibernate with spring to interact with the database Developed JSPs with Custom Tag Libraries for control of the business processes in the middletier and was involved in their integration Developed several controller classes as required for the design such as Abstract
