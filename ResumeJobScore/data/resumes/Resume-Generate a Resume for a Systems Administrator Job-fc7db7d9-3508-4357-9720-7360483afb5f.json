for order and trade reconciliation The system could be configured to accept trade and order files from the clients or access database of client systems At the end of the day the open ordertrade quantities and their particular details would be matched with both the sides and verified for any discrepancies After comparing two record lists the reconciliation system generates a list of all nonmatching records for client for further user action and modifications This reconciliation system provides a web user interface to present the result and all the details for client Responsibilities Involved in creating design documents for the project using Rational Rose tool UML and J2EE design patterns Designed and developed application based on Struts MVC framework Employed Data Transfer Object Data Access Object Business Delegate Service Locator and Singleton design patterns for the above framework Developed Struts Dispatch Action classes and DynaAction Forms using Struts framework Configured the WebSphere80 application server and deployed the web components Developed all J2EE components using Eclipse 36 Involved in developing the business logic using the session and entity beans and persistency layer classes with EJB30 Designed and developed the user interface using Struts View component JSP HTML CSS and JavaScript Worked on XML using SAX and DOM parsers ANT was used for the entire build process Used XSLXSLT for transforming XML documents Experience with Angular JS JQuery Bootstrap JavaScript Perl AJAX Adobe Flex JSON HTML DHTML CSS Tiles Tag Libraries Design patterns are extensively used to achieve clean separation of different layers Used different patterns like Adapter Singleton Strategy Factory Abstract Factory MVC DAO and Service Locator Facade Developed the SOAP web services Involved in the implementation of connection pooling techniques for JDBC to optimize database activities Used CVS for version controlling and JUnit for unit testing

Engineer Philips Bengaluru Karnataka April 2010 to October 2012 Description It is a web enabled system for business process The customer agent or trader can place orders request for a quote or enter into contract exchange information about the contract or request changes to the contract and track the order till it is shipped to their location The total application helps in imposing the standards and strategies that are put forward in the actual world with the use of Electronic media which helps the user to buy goods online The project has 3 modules Customer Orders Items which makes user to interact easily while buying goods or checking order status and items status Through the system the internal users of sales and marketing division can create contracts exchange information with the customer finance and shipping agent Responsibilities Involved in analysis design and development and developed specs that include Use Cases Class Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams Successfully Implemented Delta Prescreen Web service The project was developed using Scrum and Agile methodologies Involved in designing the user interfaces using HTML DHTML CSS and JSPs Developed custom tags JSTL to support custom User Interfaces Worked on I frame SpringStruts Framework in implementing business logic to interact with the Hibernate for object relational mapping and other business processes of the system Developed Form Beans which are used to store data when the user submits the HTML form Developed Action classes which are part of controller class evaluates date form beans by invoking methods on BDs and then forwards to some other action or JSP Rich User Interface is achieved within the Application with the usage of custom JavaScript functions and JQuery plugins Designed Application flow and Developed UML diagrams for the application using Rational Rose Interacted with DBA team to resolve Performance issues related slow Data load for services involving several complex SQL queries having slow response time Used ANT Script to Build WAR and EAR files and deployed on Web sphere and Used Maven during the application deployment Environment Java J2EE Servlets JSP JDBC

payment information from different Countries by the Dealers When dealer submit claims through mainframe application that data will be saved into Network Attachment Storage NAS These files stored in different format Every claim has number of claims if submitted information is correct it will be processed and give the response success if submitted data might have any duplicate data then claim will be rejected and send Exception message to the Dealer Responsibilities Participated in Functional and Systems Requirements Modelling sessions to create System Requirements for the application Involved in building GUI using JSF JSP JavaScript Html and CSS Used MVC architecture framework like Struts to implement user interfaces Implemented validations and tiles for web pages using struts validation

Description The system is used for order and trade reconciliation The system could be configured to accept trade and order files from the clients or access database of client systems At the end of the day the open ordertrade quantities and their particular details would be matched with both the sides and verified for any discrepancies After comparing two record lists the reconciliation system generates a list of all nonmatching records for client for further user action and modifications This reconciliation system provides a web user interface to present the result and all the details for client Responsibilities Involved in creating design documents for the project using Rational Rose tool UML and J2EE design patterns Designed and developed application based on Struts MVC framework
