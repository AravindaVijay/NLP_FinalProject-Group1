fusion pricing system for Fedex Express Freight and Ground services Developed a standalone application to subscribe JMS Messages JDBC module to interface with Database and a MIIGClientBase to invoke Mainframe transactions Responsibilities Involved working in Various Stages of Software Development Life Cycle SDLC Implemented Agile Methodology in the Development Process Analyzing functional requirements sequences for the new enhancements Integration Deployment and testing Determine Workflow and develop system based on that Involved working in Object Oriented Design Development Involved in design and implementation of Asynchronous messaging using JMS Used JMS API for asynchronous communication by publishing messages in the Message queue Developed a Spring JMS subscriber to receive messages from JMS queues Developed a Spring JDBC module to interface with DB2 database Developed XML Validation and Transformation modules Implemented parsing the xml messages and retrieve the node values when data gets pushed to PPS as JMS messages Developed XPath Expression to get the Node Values of the transaction Developed a JAVA process for XML to Fixed Record conversion Developed a JAVA process to invoke MainFrame MIIG transactions for the FedEx Integrated MIIGClientBase Working on a standalone application using DB2 as backend Database Performed unit testing using JUnit 40 framework for testing all developed Modules Used log4j for logging monitoring errors and exceptions all across the application Using SVN version control tools to manage source repository Configured and deployed the application on WebSphere Application Server Developed the Use Cases Activity Sequence and Class diagrams Participated in Code Integration and Unit Testing Involved working with QA team in system
