and custom views and controls Apps were built with a range of versions from iOS 40 to iOS 60 in both ARC and Manual Reference Count runtimes Senior Software Developer Visteon Troy MI 2009 to 2011 From 20010 to 2011 I worked on CaliberRM Ive ported the VSTS 2005VSTS 2008 integration to VSTS 2010 this required changing the compiler to VS 2010 changing the framework to NET 40 updating the Visual Studio integration components migrating the install from packages to VSIX and updating the VSTS SDK to VSTS 2010 SDK Ive enhanced Document Factory 2 to support the LIKE operator this required learning JavaCC and JJTree writing an expression convertor to change LIKE expression to Regular Expressions In addition I was the group expert on the ESX and Lab Manager servers the StarTeam repository administrator and the coordinator of the transition of development from Singapore to Troy JScript API 2009 to 2010 I worked on DevPartner Studio I updated the JavaScript profiler to work with IE 8 this required handling the multiple process environment that IE 8 introduced adapting to changes in the Debugger for JScript API and working through BEX exceptions that occurred while injecting into COM objects I also maintained the DPRender report generation utility helped port DevPartner Studios VSTS integration to VSTS 2010 and worked on internationalization Software Developer Compuware Detroit MI 1999 to 2009 From 2007 to 2009 I worked on DevPartner Studio I created the DPRender report generation utility DPRender used a standard XSL transformer with some additional custom metadata to transform DevPartner sessions into HTML reports Its a simple single dialog UI that allowed a user to select which report what session files and other custom data to put into the report In addition I worked on updating the JavaScript profiler to work with IE 7 this required learning the existing profiler and the Microsoft Debugger for JScript API working with developers at Microsoft to break the dependency on MDM and updating some of the interprocess communication code I also maintained the Cruise ControlNET server and was the group expert on Perforce and the build system Plus I gave web based presentations instructing viewers how to include code coverage tests in their existing continuous integration testing From 2005 to 2007 I worked on Vantage View I prototyped a custom MVC framework in JavaScript I implemented El Gamal encryption in C I prototyped a window control a dashboard control mainframe style table controls and mainframe style textboxes in JavaScript From 1999 to 2005 I worked on QALoad I helped write a web browser which has no graphical user interface The web browser had an HTML DOM a download engine and a script command API Using simple script commands such as Navigate_To and Click_On virtual users navigated the web like a real user in front of a GUI Web browser For this browser I wrote an HTML lexer and parser using Flex and C I implemented a single threaded HTTP download engine that simulates the multithreaded downloading I created low level classes like an efficient copyonwrite string class with I18N support a URL class and a cookie class these all were built to conserve memory by pooling buffers and to reduce defects when working with these error prone items Education BS in Computer Science in Computer Science University of Michigan
