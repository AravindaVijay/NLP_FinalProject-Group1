entities It is flexible for users to customize the views and reports of the market entities based on their choices and requirements like current face value market value and historical data and other details Risk is that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by change in market conditions such as market movements This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations andor activities including loans deposits securities short term harrowing s long term debts trading account assets liabilities mortgage banking activities and derivatives Market Risk Applications belongs to an architect engineer designer subject matter expert developer or business expertanalyst supporting technology solutions which effectively influence and

business requirements and business environments to support or maintain technology solutions which provides management and guidance to support achieving business objectives MRX Part of the MRX development team Programming on FlexJavaMSTR MRX is the Market Risk Web Portal which housed specific risk applications such as VaR Reporting and Limits Market Risk is the risk that the value of assets liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions Market Risk arises from the fluctuating prices of securities and other investments as they are traded in the global markets Prices of holdings change on a daily basis Market Risk always exists its varying impact however is dependant on the external environment IRCCRM Incremental Risk Change Comprehensive Risk Measure All these are used to calculate charges that are needed so that we can adequately sound if ever things blow up It started monitoring them on weekly basis When there are changes weve to explain what caused this change Since data is so vast and since the calculations are on one file but the exposures on another we need a tool to marry the two sets So we can quickly say that our IRCCRM went up because of x positions Where this x position decreased y amount or if any new product came in causing the IRCCRM numbers to change Impact Analysis Part of the IA development team Programming on Quartz
