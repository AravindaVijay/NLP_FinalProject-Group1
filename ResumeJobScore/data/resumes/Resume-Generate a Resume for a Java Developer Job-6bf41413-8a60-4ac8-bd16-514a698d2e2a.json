oracle dba data migration from oracle databases to PostgreSQL database in AWS cloud Installedconfigured PostgreSQL 95 96 and recently worked with PostgreSQL VERSIONS 10 Tuned autovacuum parameters to ensure up to date table stats and reclaim space consumed by dead tuples Proactively managed standby replication and hot standby for disaster recovery Managed and monitored these databases using PgAdmin psql tools Used pg_Hero for Performance TUNING mostly SQL Tuning using EXPLAIN ANAYZE and PG_STAT_ACTIVITY Created roles granting privileges creating tables use of indexes and primary foreign key constraints as required Performed maintenance activities like vacuum vacuum full analyze Checking the auto vacuum jobs customized vacuum on certain tables and columns Used Pg_Bouncer for connection pooling pg_Badger for generating statistic reports Experienced in tuning PostgreSQL database settings Troubleshooting performance issues Managing Users and Tablespace on PostgreSQL Servers
