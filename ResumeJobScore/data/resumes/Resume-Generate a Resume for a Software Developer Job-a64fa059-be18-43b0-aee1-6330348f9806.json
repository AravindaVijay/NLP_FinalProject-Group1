developertpvisioncom Processes information per boot cycle giving cpu load graphs log stats graph errors other statistics Gives the call stack for debug dump and maps directly to the source code on opengrok based on appropriate version When the logs are very large analyzing per boot cycle and dumps becomes easy as the information is upfront ready Processing a new dumplog 1gb 510min But it takes hours to Analyzespeculate using classical methods such as Notepad analysis plugin or glogg Need not download the logs on to the PClaptop but instead feed it to the application as a link and see the
