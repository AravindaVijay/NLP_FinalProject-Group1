including Bower Grunt and Gulp Work Experience Contracted Front End Developer Rinck Advertising Auburn ME May 2014 to Present Responsibilities Many of my responsibilities are laid out in detail below but in short I helped to streamline the companys development process to shorten the time from discovery to site launch I helped research and document new procedures and current design and development standards and trends I helped write new hire positions and review potential candidates I was also responsible for completing development on an already threeweeksoverdue Bluewaterca site as well as a number of other stillindevelopment sites Accomplishments Rinck Advertising had lost all of its digital team members but one when I began freelancing for the company and as part of my employ they requested that I help develop procedures and standards for its new digital team They had never produced any sites using modern design trends or responsive development their sites were built entirely on the Drupal platform and standards were nearly nonexistent I created a JSHTMLCSS code style guide to ensure that myself the other developer and any new hires were writing consistent code I explored each of our clients Analytics reports to determine a new browser targeting scheme as a significant amount of development time was being wasted supporting obsolete lowtraffic browsers I created a 100point checklist for the development process including predevelopment prelaunch accessibility standardization performance optimization and postlaunch items I began collecting examples of modern design trends for our design department including everything from style tiles and moodboards to responsive UI design techniques as well as initiating training of designers in basic HTML and CSS to remove the need for timely and expensive comps and allow for rapid prototyping I helped write the open job positions for new hires as well as analyzing potential employees technical assessments and past work I am currently in the process of researching smaller more lightweight development platforms as Drupal is a bit weighty for their current needs I also helped introduce frameworks such as Skeleton and Bootstrap to the internal design and documentation process including writing a small Gulp task runner to handle these rapid prototypes and documentation Skills Used Expertise in

primarily projectbased as their inhouse developers handled the daily operational work Initially I worked as part of a twoperson team in an effort to bring older markup and code up to modern standards Moving on from that I worked on a solo project to integrate a new customerfacing vendor chat email and telephony service Finally the final five months of my contract were as part of a fourperson team developing a new responsive front end that would be served specifically to customers browsing on tablet devices with the goal of eventually replacing LLBeans mobile platform Accomplishments The majority of my time was spent gridding and responsifying the existing front end markup of the LL Bean ecommerce platform A good amount of time went into shoehorning the companys massive collection of CSS into streamlined SCSS based on the SMACSS architecture Some work also went into page load and JS optimization helping to bring the responsive sites load times down significantly Skills Used Knowledge of best practices and industry standards were absolutely necessary for this job A strong understanding of jQuery and JavaScript was required on a daily basis Source version control was required for all projects via IBM ClearCase For our chat integration project I demonstrated the ability to communicate effectively with vendors and their engineers and incorporate existing code libraries with our existing platform Though not a Java developer I was required to be able to read modify and in some instances write back end JSP code when necessary Primarily much of my time was

including Bower Grunt and Gulp Work Experience Contracted Front End Developer Rinck Advertising Auburn ME May 2014 to Present Responsibilities Many of my responsibilities are laid out in detail below but in short I helped to streamline the companys development process to shorten the time from discovery to site launch I helped research and document new procedures and current design and development standards and trends I helped write new hire positions and review potential candidates I was also responsible for completing development on an already threeweeksoverdue Bluewaterca site as well as a number of other stillindevelopment sites Accomplishments Rinck Advertising had lost all of its digital team members but one when I began freelancing for the company and as part of my employ they requested that I help develop procedures and standards for its new digital team They had never produced any sites using modern design trends or responsive development their sites were built entirely on the Drupal platform and standards were nearly nonexistent I created a JSHTMLCSS code style guide to ensure that myself the other developer and any new hires were writing consistent code I explored each of our clients Analytics reports to determine a new browser targeting scheme as a significant amount of development time was being wasted supporting obsolete lowtraffic browsers I created a 100point checklist for the development process including predevelopment prelaunch accessibility standardization performance optimization and postlaunch items I began collecting examples of modern design trends for our design department including everything from style tiles and moodboards to responsive UI design techniques as well as initiating training of designers in basic HTML and CSS to remove the need for timely and expensive comps and allow for rapid prototyping I helped write the open job positions for new hires as well as analyzing potential employees technical assessments and past work I am currently in the process of researching smaller more lightweight development platforms as Drupal is a bit weighty for their current needs I also helped introduce frameworks such as Skeleton and Bootstrap to the internal design and documentation process including writing a small Gulp task runner to handle these rapid prototypes and documentation Skills Used Expertise in

Design Product Photography and other branding work Occasional bar pianist Front End Web Developer LL Bean via TEKSystems Freeport NY July 2013 to March 2014 Responsibilities Work with LLBean was primarily projectbased as their inhouse developers handled the daily operational work Initially I worked as part of a twoperson team in an effort to bring older markup and code up to modern standards Moving on from that I worked on a solo project to integrate a new customerfacing vendor chat email and telephony service Finally the final five months of my contract were as part of a fourperson team developing a new responsive front end that would be served specifically to customers browsing on tablet devices with the goal of eventually replacing LLBeans mobile platform Accomplishments The majority of my time was spent gridding and responsifying the existing front end markup of the LL Bean ecommerce platform A good amount of time went into shoehorning the companys massive collection of CSS into streamlined SCSS based on the SMACSS architecture Some work also went into page load and JS optimization helping to bring the responsive sites load times down significantly Skills Used Knowledge of best practices and industry standards were absolutely necessary for this job A strong understanding of jQuery and JavaScript was required on a daily basis Source version control was required for all projects via IBM ClearCase For our chat integration project I demonstrated the ability to communicate effectively with vendors and their engineers and incorporate existing code libraries with our existing platform Though not a Java developer I was required to be able to read modify and in some instances write back end JSP code when necessary Primarily much of my time was spent learning and refining SASS and the SMACSS architecture incorporating it into our front end in the form of grid frameworks and media queries Senior Developer Interactive Marketing Group November
