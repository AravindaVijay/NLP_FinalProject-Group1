duties Key Accomplishments Decreased the number of critical Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities found on the network from 85 to 52 within two weeks Created a custom fixlet on the BigFix console that remediated thousands of critical Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities by upgrading all old versions Reduced false positives on the network by deploying a fixlet that removed old registry entries of Adobe Flash Player from applicable systems Deployed a baseline on the BigFix console that updated all applicable systems Conducted extensive research and testing to create a more accurate way for the agency to track Adobe Flash player vulnerabilities Communicated with the correlating vendor and agency POCs to officially validate the method as the best way to track the Adobe Flash Player installations After implementing this new method the Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities within the environment instantly dropped from 938 to 51 Leadership is now looking into incorporating this new method within all USDA agencies Made significant contributions in reducing the total number of high vulnerabilities on the agencys Cybersecurity Scorecard from 26 vulnerabilities per endpoint to 5 vulnerabilities per endpoint by assessing security events identifying highmediumlow vulnerabilities and taking corrective action Considerably helped remediate the WannaCry Cyberattack vulnerability by scanning systems and contacting correlating IT specialists to update their systems with the latest patch Helped enforce the blocking of systems from the Network until they were successfully patched These actions helped substantially protect the network from this notable ransomware vulnerability Within four weeks of taking on management of the agencys Information Security Awareness training I

further secure the environment and drastically decrease the number of vulnerabilities on the network by allowing more systems to receive essential security patches This strategy would also aid in immensely improving the Agencys Cybersecurity scorecard Creates custom BigFix web reports and deploys custom vulnerability scans to aid customers in identifying vulnerabilities found on their systems
