Present Constructed database security policy using passwords privileges user profiles Transparent Data Encryption to encrypt tables and Tablespaces implemented auditing policies as well as data redaction and data masking Designed backup strategies following company SLA execution of backup schedule for both physical and logical backups using RMAN and DATAPUMP utilities respectively Used block change tracking BCT reducing backup time from 5hrs down to 45mins Resolved space issues with backup optimization reducing storage costs by 20 Championed database migration from 10g to 11g and upgrade to 12c using the Oracle Datapump and DBUA respectively Installed and configured software for Oracle 10g 11g 12c on both Windows and UNIX platforms using Oracle OFA Also installed administered and

performance views DBMS_STATS Trace files System Event Logs for unusual events and took appropriate action according to company policies of incident reports Implemented table and index partitioning and materialized views to minimize DB time increase disk load balancing improve query speed and enable faster parallel query Capacity planning to meet the demands of the dynamic aspects of storage and memory for the databases Cloned databases for testing using RMAN and DATAPUMP utilities for all database sizes Installed 12c OEM Cloud Control for monitoring periodically reorganized and resized database objects created table Partitions Materialized Views and indexes yielding a 35 performance boost Performed database Refreshes from production environments Performed PLSQL errors fixes and

DBAs Part of the support team for 247 oncall production support Database Administrator US Department of Health and Human Services Washington DC August 2015 to August 2017 Created databases from Entity Relational Diagrams ERD in Forward Engineering using the Oracle SQL Developer to OFA Institution and finally to DB launch System Development Life Cycle SDLC methodology for designing analysis development and implementation Used range hash and composite table partitioning which greatly decreased the DB time and SQL Execution time Also performed instance tuning by changing initora parameters and managed region parameters such as shared_pool_size and db_cache_size with the use of AMM and ASMM Managed database security by creating assigning appropriate roles and privileges to users depending on the user activity auditing and performing other security related tasks including Transparent Data Encryption Configured Oracle tools like SQLNet to access the database across the network Expert in working with PLSQL including Procedures Functions Cursors and Triggers Applied Oracles quarterly Critical Patch Update CPU PSU application using Opatch utility to install test and deploy patches to all database instances Created and managed pluggable databases in the multitenant container database of the Oracle 12c architecture Experience migrating database objects from development through test and into production environments Capacity planning supported 3 tier architecture planning of tables indexes tablespaces and databases to allow for growth potential and analyze data growth trends for capacity and resources Database Administrator Techteam Columbia MD August 2012 to August 2015 Implemented dataguard on Oracle 9i and 10g to implement a disaster recovery plan Conducted replication of tables from databases outside the network using materialized viewssnapshots Created scripts to create the snapshot logs for the databases outside the network Configured Oracle 10g to gather statistics automatically by setting the STATISTICS_LEVEL parameter to typical Supported Production databases and took care of any memory issues Configured memory for automatic tuning by setting the SGA_TARGET parameter Suggested DB architecture and created the databases in accordance to the requirements Suggested backup and recovery plan Cold backups were scheduled for every week Created packages for various database requirements Wrote scripts to identify segments that are being used in queries but are not giving good performance Example Full table scans should be avoided on large tables Indexes and hints can help improve performance Created scripts to identify the progress of queries Able to see exactly how many records have been entered during a transaction Used new EXPDP and IMPDP utilities to conduct export and import This is a lot faster than the conventional export and imports Helped developers to troubleshoot slow performance Reasons could be insufficient sort space or insufficient memory or tablespace Used Job scheduler and resource manager to schedule jobs and setting priorities to jobs Created full fledged documentation on the Disaster Recovery and Database
