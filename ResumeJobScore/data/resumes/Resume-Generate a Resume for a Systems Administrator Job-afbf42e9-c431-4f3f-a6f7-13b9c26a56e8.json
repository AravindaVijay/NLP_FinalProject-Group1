Technologies Hyderabad Telangana January 2015 to June 2015 The project was about developing a tool which creates visual shapes using the shapefile concept point polyline and polygon It takes multiple input values and basing on those values the output would be formatted The input values are primarily the location points and altitude values The input can be given manually using UI of tool or can be given by excel or CSV files The output would be shaped in visual 3d model and presented in picture format Visual 3D presentation can be achieved with the usage of VPython Involved in building database Model APIs and Views utilizing Python in order to build an interactive solution Used Python scripts to update content in the database and manipulate files Worked with Python OO Design code for manufacturing quality monitoring logging and debugging code Used Python unit and functional testing modules such as unit test unittest2 mock and custom frameworks inline with Agile Software Development methodologies With a team of 3 developed an application for GIS engineers using PYTHON which creates shapefile shapefilepoint or line or polygon shape with any data belonging to it by inputting appropriate latitude longitude altitude values into the table Using Numpy module we created arrays which can store multiple input values and also manipulate the values in a way to configure the process flow The API was designed by us using the Tkinter module which is the primary module used in the industry to create any kind of graphical UI Designed the API in a way that one can even convert a CSV file to shp files provided they are tabulated properly Designed the style of output in a way that it can be viewed in the form of 3D shape and this can be achieved with usage of VPython

input values and basing on those values the output would be formatted The input values are primarily the location points and altitude values The input can be given manually using UI of tool or can be given by excel or CSV files The output would be shaped in visual 3d model and presented in picture format Visual 3D presentation can be achieved with the usage of VPython Involved in building database Model APIs and Views utilizing Python in order to build an interactive solution Used Python scripts to update content in the database and manipulate files Worked with Python OO Design code for manufacturing quality monitoring logging and debugging code Used Python unit and functional testing modules such as unit test unittest2 mock and custom frameworks inline with Agile Software Development methodologies With a team of 3 developed an application for GIS engineers using PYTHON which creates shapefile shapefilepoint or line or polygon shape with any data belonging to it by inputting appropriate latitude longitude altitude values into the table Using Numpy module we created arrays which can store multiple input values and also manipulate the values in a way to configure the process flow The API was designed by us using the Tkinter module which is the primary module used in the industry to create any kind of graphical UI Designed the API in a way that one can even convert a CSV file to shp files provided they are tabulated properly Designed the style of output in a way that it can be viewed in the form of 3D shape and this can be achieved with usage of VPython Used Matrix concepts for integrating the altitude field in API Education MS in Computer Science University of Central Missouri Warrensburg MO December 2016 BTech in Digital Techniques for Designing
