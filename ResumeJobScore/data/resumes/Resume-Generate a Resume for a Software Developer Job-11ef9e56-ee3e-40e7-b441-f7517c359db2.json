Insights This project has two modules 1 Spending categories and 2 Spending Alert The module Spending Alert is a smart algorithm in Moven Banks mobile app Its purpose is to understand the spending behavior of its users from their history transactions and to alert them in real time when they spend more than the usual individual and cumulative transaction amount in a month The initial point of the project is Spending categories with Ruby on Rails as backend It informs the customers about their average typical trend learnt from history transactions and current amount for every spending category Groceries rent entertainment and travel etc by that time in month Responsibilities Adapted ModelViewViewModel MVVM pattern for developing the UI of the application by Single Page Application SPA technology of Angular Js Created components using React Js Built web pages using responsive web technologies Bootstrap Js CSS3 D3 Js HTML5 Implemented the module Spending Alert using Node Js as backend and Express Js as a middleware and MongoDB as a data client Implemented the module Spending trend with categories using MVC framework Ruby on Rails as backend and PostgreSQL as data client Created interactive graphs using D3 Js to help the customers understand their spending insights but utilizing the available mobile screen space Consumed the data fetched from Web services via JSONXML response using RESTful services web API Utilized database tuning techniques to improve data IO efficiency Using WebStorm IDE made debugging the JavaScript code time saving Translated and compared the Business goals to the application design Participated in all stages of the development lifecycle discussions including requirement analysis algorithm design and analysis development implementation and maintenance Used Microsoft Visio for a better algorithm analysis and to supplement the continuous improvement process of the algorithm Had a critical role in reviewing the application design and

is an internal application through which the employees manage the bookings and create reports at the end of the transaction Main focus was to make the application respond faster to the internal requests by the employees Search Engine Optimization was the key feature supporting the backend of the application It is useful to search and compare the prices and other insights from across the wide range of retailers available This also includes geospatial analysis of transaction data and submitting reports to the marketing team and executive team Responsibilities Developed the application in APICentric Architecture by extensively using MEAN Stack technologies which contains MongoDB Express Js Angular Js and Node Js Collaborated with data analysis team to analyze the transaction traffic density Used Matplotlib GDAL OGR Folium and Basemap libraries of Python to extract and manipulate geospatial data Created frontend using Angular Js Bootstrap HTML CSS3 SASS and JavaScript Catered a range of devices by developing a responsive interface for the application using HTML5 CSS3 ES6 JavaScript Bootstrap Js and Angular Js Configured the serverside routing using Express Js to consume JSON data from RESTful Service Angular Js services and factories were exploited to create modular and loosely coupled application architecture with lightweight API routing Used SASS to write a DRY and maintainable CSS code Optimized the server load by doing partial validations and user authentication by using Angular Js validations Used PostgreSQL as the database for some modules of the application Gathered requirements and business logic from Business Analysts and coordinated with the development team to design fit the algorithm by continuous brainstorming on finding a more technically improved

behavior of its users from their history transactions and to alert them in real time when they spend more than the usual individual and cumulative transaction amount in a month The initial point of the project is Spending categories with Ruby on Rails as backend It informs the customers about their average typical trend learnt from history transactions and current amount for every spending category Groceries rent entertainment and travel etc by that time in month Responsibilities Adapted ModelViewViewModel MVVM pattern for developing the UI of the application by Single Page Application SPA technology of Angular Js Created components using React Js Built web pages using responsive web technologies Bootstrap Js CSS3 D3 Js HTML5 Implemented the module Spending Alert using Node Js as backend and Express Js as a middleware and MongoDB as a data client Implemented the module Spending trend with categories using MVC framework Ruby on Rails as backend and PostgreSQL as data client Created interactive graphs using D3 Js to help the customers understand their spending insights but utilizing the available mobile screen space Consumed the data fetched from Web services via JSONXML response using RESTful services web API Utilized database tuning techniques to improve data IO efficiency Using WebStorm IDE made debugging the JavaScript code time saving Translated and compared the
