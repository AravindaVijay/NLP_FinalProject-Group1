Present Worked as the principal investigator and researcher designer architect and lead software developer for the Film Automatic Title Matching Project The ambitious goal was to automatically match millions of random movie titles from the internet to known movie titles My title matching algorithm results were fed into another Data Science project for predicting Film Box Office performance based on social media activity on the internet I designed and developed an innovative solution with an intelligent scoring and grading system that can process over 1 million title matches per hour per computer It can be scalable across multiple computers It uses multiple algorithms to parse tokenize index and search for movie titles Regular Expressions were also heavily used to match for string patterns as well as datawrangling techniques for data manipulation My proprietary algorithm uses a hierarchical multilevel heuristic weighted scoring system to score and grade different aspects of a movie title in order to make an intelligent decision and select the correct title It also used additional meta data to help improve selection accuracy This allowed for intelligent decisions to be made with mathematical precision I built a highperformance memorydriven objectindexed keyvalue pair database with access speed that outperformed regular SQL databases For comparison an SQL approach did 400k lookups per minute My technology performed in excess of 20 million lookups per minute an improvement of over 50 times the best SQL system The technology and algorithms that I designed can also be

Present Worked as the principal investigator and researcher designer architect and lead software developer for the Film Automatic Title Matching Project The ambitious goal was to automatically match millions of random movie titles from the internet to known movie titles My title matching algorithm results were fed into another Data Science project for predicting Film Box Office performance based on social media activity on the internet I designed and developed an innovative solution with an intelligent scoring and grading system that can process over 1 million title matches per hour per computer It can be scalable across multiple computers It uses multiple algorithms to parse tokenize index and search for movie titles Regular Expressions were also heavily used to match for string patterns as well as datawrangling techniques for data manipulation My proprietary algorithm uses a hierarchical multilevel heuristic weighted scoring system to score and grade different aspects of a movie title in order to make an intelligent decision and select the correct title It also used additional meta data to help improve selection accuracy This allowed for intelligent decisions to be made with mathematical precision I built a highperformance memorydriven objectindexed keyvalue pair database with access speed that outperformed regular SQL databases For comparison an SQL approach did 400k lookups per minute My technology performed in excess of 20 million lookups per minute an improvement of over 50 times the best SQL system The technology and algorithms that I designed can also be used for any other situation where an intelligent decision needs to be made from a large set of data The program code is written in Python is objectoriented functionallydriven and thoroughly
