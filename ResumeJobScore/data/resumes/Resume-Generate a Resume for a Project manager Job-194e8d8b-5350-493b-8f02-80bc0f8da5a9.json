using migration tools Setting up AWS infrastructure by creating public private subnets Route Tables NAT devices VPC Peering Creating required Security Groups IAM Roles for specified EC2 Instances Configured ELB to route traffic to instances sitting on different availability zones and added them to AutoScaling group to achieve high availability Used VS Code to access the application code and worked on implementing the code to achieve required functionalities Worked on Installing Mongo DB and Nodejs applications on an EC2 instance for development Installed MongoDB Enterprise edition to use it for client data storage on aEC2 instance Enabled Mongo dB Authentication and attached User Role to the required database to Securely authenticate mongo shell from command line Successfully migrated
