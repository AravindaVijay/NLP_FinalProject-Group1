County Waukesha WI September 2018 to Present Research data engineering trends and software Create training videos about Power BI report visualization techniques for business report creators While building reports for the Waukesha County website traffic I learned how to properly query Google Analytics to Power BIThis was an incredibly slow procedureI built an R script data retrieval tool that would interact with the Google Analytics API much fasterI showed my project to my manager who then found a module that would insert the Google Analytics data into a SQL database and then set the script to run on a scheduleI then proceeded to build a report that is now automatically updated dailyAll ETL data cleansing was completed in Power BIWe are now mapping the data properly in SQL Server While building a report for new employee survey data I was required to collect the survey data from an EPI Server APIThe survey forms were built with no data validation or verification which caused some problemsBecause of the lack of verification users would repeatedly click the submit button and create multiple entries that had to be removedBecause of the lack of validation users were able to enter anything into the name fieldI was able to use PowerShell to retrieve and cleanse dataThe data was used to create and automate an interactive excel spreadsheet that the report users would be able to use to enter user dataPowerShell was used to load that data and the survey data into SQL ServerSQL was used to further clean and transform the data while Power BI was then used to build interactive
