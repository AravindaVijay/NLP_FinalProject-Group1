requirements and accomplish objectives provided by the Northrop Grumman aerospace company Part of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Simulations Team constructing models of the UAVs in order to obtain important aerodynamic properties to perform flight test simulations Worked directly with the UAVs to take accurate measurements in order to model it Designed accurate aerodynamic models of the UAVs using the program AVL a program for the aerodynamic and flight dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft of arbitrary configuration Modeled all lifting surfaces control surfaces and fuselage Created data and run files of mass properties corresponding with each UAV Executed the run files for each UAV in order to obtain a full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state with specified mass properties Extracted stability axis derivatives that will be imported into the flight simulation program FlightGear to model the simulated plane to have the same flight characteristics and behaviors

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Aeronautical Development and Design Structural Analysis and in related areas inside a competitive environment where I will use my experience to best serve the needs of the company Skills MATLAB AVL C Programming Microsoft Word Microsoft Excel Microsoft PowerPoint Professional Experience Company Name October 2013 to Current Collaborating with others to meet mission requirements and accomplish objectives provided by the Northrop Grumman aerospace company Part of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Simulations Team constructing models of the UAVs in order to obtain important aerodynamic properties to perform flight test simulations Worked directly with the UAVs to take accurate measurements in order to model it Designed accurate aerodynamic models of the UAVs using the program AVL a program for the aerodynamic and flight dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft of arbitrary configuration Modeled all lifting surfaces control surfaces and fuselage Created data and run files of mass properties corresponding with each UAV Executed the run files for each UAV in order to obtain a full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state with specified mass properties Extracted stability axis derivatives that will be imported into the flight simulation program FlightGear to model the simulated plane to have the same flight characteristics and behaviors as the UAVS Company Name October 2013 to Current Collaborating with a team to design and construct an aircraft that will be competing at the SAE Aero Design West Sanded the balsa wood wings smooth for the preparation of carbon fiber wrapping Prepared the epoxy resin mixture for application Wrapped the leading edge wing spars fuselage molds and fuselage walls with carbon fiber Sawed and drill cutted fuselage components Aeronautics F 22 Project Winter 2014 Performed as Team Leader for a team of four for the experimentation and analysis of flight dynamics and parameters of Lockheed Martin s F 22 Raptor Implemented low speed wind and water tunnel testing using test models to obtain and investigate flight dynamics and performance characteristics Analyzed the flow vortices over the wing at varying velocities at increasing angles of attacks Calculated and observed the relationship and importance of the effect of Reynold s numbers on aerodynamic coefficients Compiled a technical report detailing the results of the calculations and observations and compared the accuracy of wind water tunnel testing to theoretical F 22 characteristics Company Name May 2013 to Current Aviation Camp Assistant City State Assist children in building and flying model aircraft launch rockets complete flight simulation missions and conduct flight related science experiments Assist in teaching course
