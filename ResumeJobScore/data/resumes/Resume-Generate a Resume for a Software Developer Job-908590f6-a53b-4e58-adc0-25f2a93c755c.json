March 2016 to Present Quantum Application This is a billing application which is used for calculating the costs associated with the orders for a given customer including calculating the postage This is a Web application created in MVC 5 Entity Framework 5 developed using Test Driven Development methodologies Worked with guiding and leading a team of 5 developers on the Postage Calculation for these orders based on the different input parameters and the categories The Postage Engine is a WCF which outputs a postage results based on different criteria Worked with business in understanding the requirements of the project and the complex billing model and also how the different postage calculations work Worked with them on a day to day basis for the same Pricing Project Enhancements Lead the pricing application team Worked with business to get a better understanding of all their pricing applications to understand and implement better solutions Improving performance of the existing rating system The rating service is a WCF service with Entity Framework 5 Implemented parallelism and batching in the service as necessary to improve performance Application Developer AECOM August 2010 to Present Some Projects Have Occurred Simultaneously Metropolitan Airports Commission Minneapolis Mobile Application Developed the Fire Preplan mobile application for Minneapolis Airport This is an ARCGIS mobile application based on ARCGIS Mobile 10 and C windows application based on NET framework 35 Developed primary tools such as buffer search and measure tools and dynamic TOC The application pulls data from a mobile cache Replicated the ArcGIS Server Service to a mobile cache and created a windows service to update cache on a daily basis Web Application Involved in database migration from Oracle to MS SQL Server Worked on updating the webservices to suit the migration Milwaukee International Airport Developed a C MVC Reporting application based on Net Framework 4 which generates reports by inserting the user entered parameters and populating the correct template The front end was developed in HTML5 with Razor syntax with entity framework model for pulling data for the application Developed a windows service application based on NET framework 35 and in C which checks for weather updates on a minute by minute basis and updates the database MS SQL server 2008 The windows service application also creates service request for the weather updates as required in the Cityworks application Created database triggers to automatically send emails to the required group when a work order status gets updated in the Cityworks application This was done in MS Sql server 2008 database environment Worked on implementing enhancements to the MKE application Developed tools such as enhanced Buffer tool Export tool and Identify tool This application was developed using Flex in Flash Builder 45 environment Worked on implementing Part 139 Inspection reports using Crystal reports This report displays Open and Closed Work Orders under varied categories for different time shifts Orlando International Airport Created and configured the Oracle Database and ArcSDE on a Linux Environment Created the geodatabase for this project in Oracle Created web services in ASPNET Implemented the Measure tool for the GIS application The tool was developed using Flex in Flash Builder 45 environment The user will be able to use the tool to measure a drawn polygon polyline and coordinates of point on the GIS application The tool allows the user to measure in different units such as square feet meter and other units as required Implemented the Identify tool for the GIS application The tool was developed using Flex in Flash Builder 45 environment The user will be able to identify features on the GIS application by drawing on the required area to be identified The user is allowed to identify features using point polyline and polygon tool Implemented the Propworks tool for the GIS application This tool was developed in Flex Flash Builder 45 environment The user is allowed to perform the following three functionalities using the Propworks tool Map Query Allows the user to query against the Propwork layers when the user draws a point polyline or polygon on the GIS application Attributes Based Search Allows the user to query against selected Propwork layers based on the user selected attributes Edit Attributes This allows the user to edit attributes of a feature once the user performs a query against the Propworks layer and the resulting attributes are displayed to the user Implemented the ECM Search Tool for the GIS application This tool allows the user to search for Projects Location information on any drawn polygon area on the map and also allows the user to query for documents on the resulting Projectlocation search results This project was developed in Flex with webservices written in ASPNET Denver International Airport Colorado Implemented the buffer tool in MVVM model for the GIS application This tool was a part of a Silverlight application and was developed in XAML and C in Visual Studio 2010 environment Migrated the application from ArcGIS 100 Configuration to 101 Configuration in development and test servers Rico Migrated the application from Flex API 25 to Flex API 451 Created web services in ASPNET Implemented the Search Identify query task Zoom to Location Zoom to Site functionalities which allow the user to search for location and details on the Rico location zoom to location based on the user entered Lat Long values identify feature details when the user clicks on the map and query samples based on the user entered specifications Vancouver International Airport Canada Implemented the Propworks tool for
