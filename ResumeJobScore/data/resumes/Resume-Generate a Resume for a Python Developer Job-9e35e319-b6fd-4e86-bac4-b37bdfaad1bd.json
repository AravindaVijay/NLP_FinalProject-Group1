can run their mainframe applications such as Cobol applications directly on Unix systems with this product This activity involves developing a layer that is common for both Unix and Windows The layer would provide socket APIs that would be used by application The layer would abstract Unix and Windows socket related calls based on the platform Responsibilities Worked as part of Unikix product development team Developing a new abstraction layerAPIs that provides platform independence Doing a proof of concept and finalizing the design for the project Changing application code to use new APIs instead of direct socket calls Bug fixing for various other product issues that are raised by end usersclients Environment C C Linux Python SUAWindows CCand Python Developer UPS Atlanta GA November 2011 to March 2014 DescriptionThis modulecomponent is meant to stressvalidate cache coherency in Power Systems The module creates multiple threads bound to different cores and runs the different threads in synchronization such that they hit the same cache linefalse sharing at the same time thereby stressing the cache controller wrt to coherency Responsibilities Rewrote cache coherency exerciser on a new framework Adding thread synchronization logic for multiple threads to run together and one at a time Adding new instructions support in exerciser for newer generations of processor
