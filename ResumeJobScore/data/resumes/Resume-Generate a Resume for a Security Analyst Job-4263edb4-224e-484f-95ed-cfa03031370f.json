select an ERP implementation partner to implement the already selected PeopleSoft ERP system to replace its legacy system As ERP Project Manager for the Auditors Office my responsibilities and accomplishments included leading the effort for the Auditors Office to Define confirm and document Harris Countys requirements at large for the new PeopleSoft ERP system Requirements were extensive as Harris County employs more than 18000 people has a budget of more 25 billion dollars and has more than 80 departments with diverse and extensive requirements The Auditors Office is a majority

critical role as the Auditors Office ERP Project Manager retired What ensued over the next year made it clear that the Harris County technology group now Universal Services owned the budget and the

finish projects or rescue projects and bring them to successful completion ERP Project Manager Harris County Auditors Office October 2015 to June 2019 In 2014 Harris County initiated a project to select an ERP implementation partner to implement the already selected PeopleSoft ERP system to replace its legacy system As ERP Project Manager for the Auditors Office my responsibilities and accomplishments included leading the effort for the Auditors Office to Define confirm and document Harris Countys requirements at large for the new PeopleSoft ERP system Requirements were extensive as Harris County employs more than 18000 people has a budget of more 25 billion dollars and has more than 80 departments with diverse and extensive requirements The Auditors Office is a majority stakeholder in the implementation of the new PeopleSoft ERP solution and would rely extensively on the systems ability to meet Harris Countys requirements Lead the process to evaluate and recommend a System Integrator consulting firm to assist the County with the PeopleSoft implementation Together with the selected System Integrator confirm the capabilities of the Peoplesoft ERP system to meet the requirements of Harris County and develop a gap analysis to be addressed by the System Integrator in developing a project framework and implementation plan In 2017 it was established that Harris Countys IT Services group would own the budget and responsibility for the implementation of the PeopleSoft ERP system In the first quarter of 2018 the Harris County Auditor who had hired me in this critical role as the Auditors Office ERP Project Manager retired What ensued over the next year made it clear that the Harris County technology group now Universal Services owned the budget and the management of the project exclusively and my role was restrictively limited Although I tried to develop required new business processes and procedures for the Auditors office that would be compliant with the PeopleSoft application capabilities it was clear that my role was limited at best As such as of June 3 2019 I resigned my position in the Auditors Office to seek a position where my expertise would be more appropriately valued and utilized TX CSMART Program Director City of Houston Houston TX January 2013 to October 2015 The City of Houston was in the process of creating a custom

had been involved in the application development I then directed and managed all the associated technical and functional activities required to complete and deploy this new application This involved a complete recommitment and reconnection with the Citys IT services group and significant City IT policy changes to facilitate the needed operational changes I determined to be required to move the project forward After two and a half years of intensive development efforts using a combination of agile and waterfall implementation methodologies with offshore and onshore development teams the application successfully went into Production April 2 2015 and is being continually incrementally improved with a structured and carefully managed defect resolution process and feature enhancement
