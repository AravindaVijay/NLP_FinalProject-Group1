rules to BoKS access control and privileged command execution Successfully deployed BoKS on 80 90 of customer facing hosts Architect access rights and privileged roles in BoKS by leveraging both data analysis whos connecting to the hosts what privileges they elevate to and what programs they execute and interfacing with the application support teams and business users to convert their requirements to BoKS access routes Facilitated user data analysis by developing Perl scripts to extract local account records SSH connectivity and SUDO privilege rules The data collected facilitated creating user

Consultant Deutsche Bank Jersey City NJ October 2012 to March 2016 Lead UNIX Security Analyst implementing SSH access control on the Banks production servers consisting of over 15000 Linux Solaris and AIX physical and VM hosts thereby ensuring the Bank complies with regulatory controls and internal audit requirements This control is implemented by locking down production servers where SSH public key management is placed under a central authority disallowing users the ability to create their own keys a Change Management request would be required to any make any alterations or additions of public keys Improved lock down implementation results by 30 40 greatly lessening the role out time to the Banks production servers This was realized by diligently reviewing the logs of the implementation scripts determining what code changes needed to be modified and promoting these changes to the implementation scripts Simplified the task of maintaining the SSH security database with

analysis whos connecting to the hosts what privileges they elevate to and what programs they execute and interfacing with the application support teams and business users to convert their requirements to BoKS access routes Facilitated user data analysis by developing Perl scripts to extract local account records SSH connectivity and SUDO privilege rules The data collected facilitated creating user

public keys Improved lock down implementation results by 30 40 greatly lessening the role out time to the Banks production servers This was realized by diligently reviewing the logs of the implementation scripts determining what code changes needed to be modified and promoting these changes to the implementation scripts Simplified the task of maintaining the SSH security database with
