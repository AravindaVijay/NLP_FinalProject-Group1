is visually appealing easy and userfriendly with the School going kids We had to adopt new methods to formulate custom components Some of the interesting components we did back then in 2005 were a Scroll Bar having both the handles at either of the ends or a Tree Table with Expansion and Collapsing feature One of the major challenges of the Applet and Java Technology then was the way AWTJFC

for Claims settlements They needed to create a single Public API interface for all the existing and new clients so that they could monetize their legacy and acquired Web Services I evaluated WSO2 as a API Provider and Mediator for custom logic and message transformation Based upon the analysis suggested the client to go for home grown implementation for Mediation and use WSO2 only for Service versioning I wrote REST API interfaces and added Spring 4 based JUnit Test cases for testing the REST Services Also created a client branded Swagger integration with the newly created APIs

2013 to November 2015 Team Size Individual Contributor Environment Windows 7 Jenkins 1509 Java 17 SVN WebKit Details Automatic Deployment Engine needed a GUI interface for the Admin Users who wanted to do application and database deployments using the Deploy Engine The Deploy Engine had 23 parameters each with distinct set of allowed values The Admin Users could do mistakes while configuring their deployments so I created a Jenkins Plugin to help them easily do the deployments The plugin would check out the sources from SVN parse the configuration files make a memory model of the configuration and lay out on the UI for the user to edit or modify The modified configuration settings were saved to an XML Contribution Requirement Analysis Confluence Documentation Design Hands on

Chase June 2014 to December 2014 Team Size 2 Environment D3 jQuery 18 Java 17 Oracle 11 Jenkins 1509 PERL Windows 7 Details Deploy Engine tool performs hundreds of deployments in a day It was required by the Management and other stakeholders to know the status of those deployments for various applications across the releases in various environments I created the Deployment Dashboard web application that polled the Audit database used by the Deployment Engine and transformed it into a data model that was used to lay out various reports as per the User selection The reports could be something like number of deployments in a given period in an environment for a release The number of combinations that could be used were quite so many and the web application took care of dynamically determining data based on selection criteria Contribution Requirement Analysis Data Model Design UI Design Hands on Development Setup and Configuration Ness Technologies October 2008 to March 2013 Lead a team to

Proprietary application Challenge for me and the team was to respond to High Availability and High Quality end user needs in a tight schedule eliminating any Technical issues to which we accepted and met very well I will never forget the Defect Burn charts and the exercises we had to do to maintain the daily counts of fixed defects I worked on Clinical application that had two interfaces Ounce and

Service client Web Application and PL SQL procedure For each configured Job the Scheduler used to invoke the Candidate Management Organization System Web Services to fetch the student data based on customer configuration and populate the Staging Temp Tables in Oracle Database Once the Staging Data was ready the Scheduler had to invoke the PL SQL Procedure called Admin Finalization Engine to create a Snapshot of the Students data so that the Clinical Web Application could query that Snapshot to build live Reports at the School or a District level Scheduler was a complex piece of software

Customer needed a robust homegrown framework to handle Exceptions and implement customizable Logging at Runtime We poposed use of AOP for both Exception Handling and Logging thereby reducing the overall impact on the Customer Facing application e1 I evaluated various AOP frameworks including AspectWerkz AspectJ and JBoss AOP and finally picked up JBoss AOP as it supported both CompileTime as well as LoadTime weaving and had the best integration possible with JBoss AS and provided better flexibility in terms of control and maintenance JBoss AS uses JMX MBeans extensively and we could use that to control the AOP feature in a configurative manner at Runtime Contribution Requirement Analysis Technology Evaluation as per the Underlying Technology Stack Packaging and Deployment

Details The application needed to produce an XML called imsmanifest and also had to form the hierarchical directory structure on the hard disk Once the imsmanifest was ready the entire content along with the XML files was placed in a ZIP Archive and uploaded to a Web Share location where the Publishing Framework had access I learnt and used Castor to form XML objects from the Java Beans so that I could write them in a file and later ZIP it At that time the concept of Marshaling and UnMarshaling using Java was the most interesting part in this project for me Contribution Requirement Analysis

Ant Applets JFC Swing Details Challenge in this project was to create a Pluggable Look And Feel in Java which was not only different than the Default PLAF provided by Sun Java Development Kit but also is visually appealing easy and userfriendly with the School going kids We had to adopt new methods to formulate custom components Some of the interesting components we did back then in 2005 were a Scroll Bar having both the handles at either of the ends or a Tree Table with Expansion and Collapsing feature One of the major challenges of the Applet and Java Technology then was the way AWTJFC components used to look under Mac and Windows and we have to ensure that the looks are as much similar as possible Contribution Coding in Java 2D API and JFC Unit Testing Other Interesting Projects
