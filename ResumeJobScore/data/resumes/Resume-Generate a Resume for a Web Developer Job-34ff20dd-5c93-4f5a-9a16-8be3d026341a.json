York NY July 2015 to Present Responsibilities Integrated a forms processing library wtforms into an internally developed content management system built with CherryPy which was previously using doing percontroller validation and directing all form errors to a generic failure page Bug fixes on an internally developed ORM Troubleshooting of memory and performance problems Sr Python Developer Bank of America Merrill Lynch New York NY July 2013 to July 2015 Responsibilities Work on the Quartz Core team developing framework libraries and tooling for use by a large inhouse development community Major contributions include A precommit code review service for changes to Mercurial repositories Project consists of a JSON api web service and a web based UI built using the web service The service uses Mercurial bundles as the unit of change rather than diffs allowing much tighter integration with the targeted revision control system This allows the system to do automatic merges and editing of submitted reviews to remove already approved and pushed changesets from outstanding reviews A querying api built for a proprietary object database The proprietary object database is basically a keyvalue store with indexing The interface is modeled after SqlAlchemys ORM querying api enabling a much more Pythonic interface to the database It also optimizes the queries based on preexisting indexes in the database A continuous integration and SDLC workflow tool which monitors collections of projects for changes and launches a build of the collection including unittests on a distributed compute grid when a change is detected The tool also allows promotion of builds between different stages of the SDLC such as integration user acceptance testing preproduction and production The framework uses pluggable policies for what should be performed at each stage of the SDLC allowing fine grained control for each project using the system Other duties include architectural design of upcoming projects providing Python usage guidance and mentoring junior engineers and interns Sr Python Developer Behr Process Group Santa Ana CA October 2012 to July 2013 Responsibilities Design and development of a custom kiosk management platform for managing 2000 to 10000 kiosks The software consists of a server backend with an html administrative interface and restful api a Dart based user interface and a python based client The platform is used for monitoring the kiosks running on demand tasks such as capturing screenshots executing a shell command and reporting its output and distributing updates Other duties include troubleshooting device failures automation of information retrieval used for reporting and mentoring junior engineers Sr Software Tools Developer Irdeto San Francisco CA October 2011 to October 2012 Work in the online technologies group of Irdeto developing self protecting digital content BD and applying the software to commercial Bluray discs Duties included maintenance and bug fixes to the existing code base incorporating new software features and development of tools typically with a web or gui component for automating processes improving workflow and providing interfaces for easy archival and retrieval of information Specific projects include A Bluray player information tracking database a secure key server and a distributed framework for automating the process of applying protection to Bluray disks which allocated jobs to a set of distributed workers All of these projects incorporated a web based interface Technical Lead Internal

York NY July 2015 to Present Responsibilities Integrated a forms processing library wtforms into an internally developed content management system built with CherryPy which was previously using doing percontroller validation and directing all form errors to a generic failure page Bug fixes on an internally developed ORM Troubleshooting of memory and performance problems Sr Python Developer Bank of America Merrill Lynch New York NY July 2013 to July 2015 Responsibilities Work on the Quartz Core team developing framework libraries and tooling for use by a large inhouse development community Major contributions include A precommit code review service for changes to Mercurial repositories Project consists of a JSON api web service and a web based UI built using the web service The service uses Mercurial bundles as the unit of change rather than diffs allowing much tighter integration with the targeted revision control system This allows the system to do automatic merges and editing of submitted reviews to remove already approved and pushed changesets from outstanding reviews A querying api built for a proprietary object database The proprietary object database is basically a keyvalue store with indexing The interface is modeled after SqlAlchemys ORM querying api enabling a much more Pythonic interface to the database It also optimizes the queries based on preexisting indexes in the database A continuous integration and SDLC workflow tool which monitors collections of projects for changes and launches a build of the collection including unittests on a distributed compute grid when a change is detected The tool also allows promotion of builds between different stages of the SDLC such as integration user acceptance testing preproduction and production The framework uses pluggable policies for what should be performed at each stage of the SDLC allowing fine grained control for each project using the system Other duties include architectural design of upcoming projects providing Python usage guidance and mentoring junior engineers and interns Sr Python Developer Behr Process Group Santa Ana CA October 2012 to July 2013 Responsibilities Design and development of a custom kiosk management platform for managing 2000 to 10000 kiosks The software consists of a server backend with an html administrative interface and restful api a Dart based user interface and a python based client The platform is used for monitoring the kiosks running on demand tasks such as capturing screenshots executing a shell command and reporting its output and distributing updates Other duties include troubleshooting device failures automation of information retrieval used for reporting and mentoring junior engineers Sr Software Tools Developer Irdeto San Francisco CA October 2011 to October 2012 Work in the online technologies group of Irdeto developing self protecting digital content BD and applying the software to commercial Bluray discs Duties included maintenance and bug fixes to the existing code base incorporating new software features and development of tools typically with a web or gui component for automating processes improving workflow and providing interfaces for easy archival and retrieval of information Specific projects include A Bluray player information tracking database a secure key server and a distributed framework for automating the process of applying protection to Bluray disks which allocated jobs to a set of distributed workers All of these projects incorporated a web based interface Technical Lead Internal Tools Development Boeing June 2008 to October 2011 Work as the Internal Tools Development lead includes evaluating existing tools for use in internal development and implementing custom solutions where offtheshelf solutions are not viable Current tools under development are a distributed continuous integration system tools to support the configuration and utilization of distributed embedded

FCSSOSCOE Titles Held Technical Lead Software Support Services and Installation Boeing February 2007 to June 2008 Work as the Software Support Services technical lead included redesigning the layout of the code base and build system to accommodate building for multiple operating systems as well as multiple versions of the software design of the development and runtime environments delivered to customers and migration of the installation methodology from a scripts and tarballs approach to an implementation utilizing RPM Other responsibilities included integration of SOSCOE with other FCS programs on customized hardware configurations Programmer Boeing June 2005 to February 2007 Work included designing and implementing cryptographic and other Information Assurance related APIs for Linux and VxWorks Personal responsibilities included building a PKI infrastructure using OpenSSL libraries and migrating the teams test code to the CppUnit testing infrastructure along with writing a
