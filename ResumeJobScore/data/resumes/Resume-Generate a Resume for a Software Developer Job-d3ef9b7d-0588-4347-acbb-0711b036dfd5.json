applications CMS SMS and TOB This experience helped me to improve my skills more into the development Responsibilities Experience in developing the application on the frontend technologies which involves Ajax frameworks like Bootstrap CSS Javascript and Jquery Involved in analysis specification design and implementation and testing phases of Software Development Life Cycle SDLC and used Agile methodology for developing application Developed an end to end appilication by using the Spring framework like Sprin MVC Developed the application UI using the latest versions like HTML5 CSS3 JQuery and Bootstrap Developed various helper classes needed following Core Java multithreaded programming and Collection classes Developed various controllers which helps in working of the application by integrating the frontend with various services and mapper classes along with DAO implementations Designed and developed the End Points Controllers Business Layer DAO Layer using HibernateJDBC template using Spring IOC Dependency Injection Extensively worked with the retrieval and manipulation of data from the SQL Database by writing queries using Rapid SQL Along with development regularly involved in Unit Testing code by using frameworks like JUnits Also used AJAX in suggestive search and to display dialog boxes with JSF and DOJO for some front end Involved in installing and configuring Maven for application builds and deployment Used application servers like Weblogic and Tomcat for deploying the web application Worked on TAM junctions in the application development for the sake of the authentication process whenever the user login into the application Developed the persistence layer using Hibernate Framework created the POJO objects and mapped using Hibernate annotations and Transaction Management Extensively used JSON to parse the data from server side to satisfy the business requirement in the Ajax calls of the application Extensively used JUnit for unit testing integration testing and production testing Used repository like GIT to maintain the version of the files and took the responsibility to do the code merges and creating new branch when new feature implementation starts Setup the continuous Integration CI and continuous Deployment CD process for the application using the Jenkins Involved in sonarcube analysis using Jenkins build and had
