configured Hibernate in hibernatecfgxml file Developed interfaces and their implementation classes to communicate with the Midtier Collaborated with Data and Application Architects to design solutions to ensure all application development testing and deployment was done successfully Documented the whole process and wrote several flow diagrams for easy understanding and future trouble shooting of errors Programmed inhouse Web Applications with the Applications Development Unit using JSP Java Servlets and JSF specifically Account Balance Collections system for School fees Ghana Water and KNUST payments Staff information system for HR Customer transaction alert system iAlert the Banks Information Portal Generated adhoc reports using SQL Involved in Unit and Integration testing Writing Ant build scripts for automation of releasemigration process IT Quality Assurance and Compliance duties to ensure that all the different IT units work effectively and did system troubleshooting to ensure that all branches work effectively Sent digitized checks from branches to the Central bank and brought back responses Used Oracle 10g as the database Environment Java 16 J2EE 16 HTML CSS AJAX JQuery

Services Corporation Miami FL US July 2010 to October 2012 Responsibilities Developed the application using Struts Framework that leverages classical Model View Controller MVC architecture Used WSAD 512 for writing code for JSP Struts and EJBs Developed Business layer using EJB Implemented Persistence layer using Hibernate that use the POJOs to represent the persistence database tuples in DB2 Designed project related documents using Visual Paradigm Unified Modeling Language tool which includes Use case Class and Sequence diagrams Spring MVC Architecture is used for developing the project Developed the Presentation layer using JSP HTML custom taglib and used AJAX JQuery based rich client for improved customer experience Developed the Business layer using Spring IOC AOP DTO and JTA Developed the Persistence layer DAO using JPA HIBERNATE with Entity Manager Additional security is added to the project using Spring Security feature Developed the project using industry standard design patterns like Singleton Business Delegate Factory Pattern for better maintenance of code and reusability Worked with defect tracking system JIRA Worked with IDE like and deployed into Apache Tomcat Web Server used Maven build tool to achieve more functionality for build process Developed the application using industry standard design patterns like Singleton Business Delegate Factory Pattern for better maintenance of code and reusability Deployed the applications on IBM WebSphere Application Server Used Java Messaging Services JMS for reliable and asynchronous exchange of important information such as payment status report to Server Used XML Web Services using SOAP protocol to transfer the amount to other application that is remote and global to different financial institutions Used SoapUI for web service testing Developed the ANT scripts for preparing WAR files used to deploy J2EE components Used Log4J to capture the log that includes runtime exceptions Developed JUnit test cases for all the developed modules Used SVN as version control Environment Java J2EE JSP Struts 1x EJB JMS JNDI DB2 HTML XML DOM SAX ANT Rational Rose WSAD Web Sphere Studio Application Developer IBM Web Sphere Application Server JavaJ2EE Developer Citigroup Jersey City NJ US September 2007 to June 2010 Responsibilities Involved in entire lifecycle activities of the project including requirement gathering analysis design and development and testing and used Rational Unified Process RUP to develop the project Involved in Object analysis design and documentation of the application model using UML Followed model view and controller architecture MVC for the project development Used Hibernate as Persistence tool to interact with Persistent database MySQL Involved in creating publishing and consuming Web Services using JAXWS 20 API and other technologies like WSDL UDDI SOAP 12 and REST Used SoapUI for web service testing Worked with defect tracking system JIRA Involved in architecture design and development of a secure scalable high volume transaction J2EE based education application used by school districts Participate in fulllife cycle development Business logic and data layer components were developed using EJBs and deployed in the Application Server XML is used to exchange data between web browser and web server and between web server and application server Configuration feature of Struts was used in the system XML is used to generate HTML code in which JavaScript is embedded Servlets JSP JNDI and other J2EE technology were used in the system Also helped to maintain the lab Worked with Eclipse and deployed into JBoss Application Server with Tomcat Server used Maven build tool to achieve more functionality for build process Used SVN
