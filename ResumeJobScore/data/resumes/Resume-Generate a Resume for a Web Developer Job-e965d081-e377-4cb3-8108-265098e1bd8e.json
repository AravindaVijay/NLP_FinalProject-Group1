Administrator who possesses strong analytical and problem solving skills My experience includes SQL Server 2005 2008 and 2012 2014 SSIS as well as clustering mirroring and high availability solutions in OLTP environments I am proficient in database backup recovery performance tuning maintenance tasks security and consolidation I am confident that I would make a beneficial addition to any company Over the course of my career thus far I have designed databases to fit a variety of needs successfully ensured the security of those databases problemsolved in order to meet both backend and frontend needs installed and tested new versions database management systems customized and installed applications and meticulously monitored performance for the smoothest frontend experience possible During my 5 to 6 years working with databases Work Experience Database Administrator Family Private Care LLC Roswell GA April 2017 to Present Confirm that backups have been made and successfully saved to a secure location Planning for backup and recovery of database information Maintaining archived data Backing up and restoring databases Contacting database vendor for technical support Generating various reports by querying from database as per needed Managing and monitoring data replication Acting as liaison with users High Availability or Disaster Recovery Logs Check your high availability andor disaster recovery process logs Depending on the solution Log Shipping Clustering Replication Database Mirroring CDP etc that you are using dictates what needs to be checked Correcting errors and

and to create production database Check the backup failure alerts correct the errors and rerun the backups Review the average duration of backup any significant changes occurred investigates on this Most of the time it happens due to networking low bandwidth Validate the backup files using restore verify only I create jobs to take care of the task and to send a notification if it fails to verify any backup Monitoring all backup and log history is cleaning when designed Find out the newly added databases and define the backup plan I do verify the free space on each drive on all servers If there is significant variance in free space from the day before research the cause of the free space fluctuation and resolve if necessary Often times log files will grow because of monthly jobs automate through a job The job runs for every one hour and reports any drive which is having less than 15 of free space I can design a SSRS report to showcase and review the delta values Confirm all

Administrator who possesses strong analytical and problem solving skills My experience includes SQL Server 2005 2008 and 2012 2014 SSIS as well as clustering mirroring and high availability solutions in OLTP environments I am proficient in database backup recovery performance tuning maintenance tasks security and consolidation I am confident that I would make a beneficial addition to any company Over the course of my career thus far I have designed databases to fit a variety of needs successfully ensured the security of those databases problemsolved in order to meet both backend and frontend needs installed and tested new versions database management systems customized and installed applications and meticulously monitored performance for the smoothest frontend experience possible During my 5 to 6 years working with databases Work Experience Database Administrator Family Private Care LLC Roswell GA April 2017 to Present Confirm that backups have been made and successfully saved to a secure location Planning for backup and recovery of database information Maintaining archived data Backing up and restoring databases Contacting database vendor for technical support Generating various reports by querying from database as per needed Managing and monitoring data replication Acting as liaison with users High Availability or Disaster Recovery Logs Check your high availability andor disaster recovery process logs Depending on the solution Log Shipping Clustering Replication Database Mirroring CDP etc that you are using dictates what needs to be checked Correcting errors and make necessary modification Modify existing databases and database management systems or direct programmers and analysts to make changes Work as part of a project team to coordinate database development and see termite project scope and limitations Train Users and answers questions Approve schedule plan and supervise the installation and testing of new products and improvements to computer systems such as the installation of new databases Review Procedures in Database management system manuals for making changes to database Select and enter codes to monitor database performance and to create production database Check the backup failure alerts correct the errors and rerun the backups Review the average duration of backup any significant changes occurred investigates on this Most of the time it happens due to networking low bandwidth Validate the backup files using restore verify only I create jobs to take care of the task and to send a notification if it fails to verify any backup Monitoring all backup and log history is cleaning when designed Find out the newly added databases and define the backup plan I do verify the free space on each drive on all servers If there is significant variance in free space from the day before research the cause of the free space fluctuation and resolve if necessary Often times log files will grow because of monthly jobs automate through a job The job runs for every one hour and reports any drive which is having less than 15 of free space I can design a SSRS report to showcase and review the delta values Confirm all serversdatabases are up and running fine Usually in an Enterprise Database Environment Third Party Tools are used to monitor Servers For database monitoring I can design a native SQL Server solution using TSQL code and a maintenance plan it run min by min and send an email to DBA team if it is not able to connect to any of the database in the instance I do design a native scripts using TSQL to
