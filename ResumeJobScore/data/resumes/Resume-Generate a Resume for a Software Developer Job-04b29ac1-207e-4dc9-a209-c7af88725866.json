Salt Lake City UT June 2015 to April 2016 UT Project Spectrum is the system facilitates the portfolio reconciliation between GoldmansachsGS and GS counter parties as per regulatory requirements Portfolio is a collection of trades between GS and GS counter party Portfolio Reconciliation is the process of comparing GS portfolio to the counter parties portfolio and highlighting any trade level discrepancies such as Market To Market values The system is based on Java based Spring architecture This Spectrum has a capability to groups  trades by portfolio sends those protfolios out for reconciliation and assists portfolio reconciliation operationsPort Rec OPS in reporting and resolving trade breaks that come as part of the reconciliation results The System also helps to provide consistency in process between two counter partiest The Spectrum enables to build Margin UI to provide Port Rec OPS to retrieve OTC result from reconciliation OPS use this UI to track the progress of reconciliation Used UML for developing Use Cases Sequence Diagrams and preliminary Class Diagrams for the system and involved in lowlevel design Extensively used IntelliJ IDE for building testing and deploying applications Developed the whole frame work for the projects based on Spring MVC Developed the presentation layer and GUI framework based on spring framework involving JSP HTML5 JavaScript AJAX CSS Involved in writing JavaScript functions and implementation of AJAX on presentation layer Involved in fixing defects and troubleshooting issues on UNIX environment and wrote Shell scripts to

Salt Lake City UT June 2015 to April 2016 UT Project Spectrum is the system facilitates the portfolio reconciliation between GoldmansachsGS and GS counter parties as per regulatory requirements Portfolio is a collection of trades between GS and GS counter party Portfolio Reconciliation is the process of comparing GS portfolio to the counter parties portfolio and highlighting any trade level discrepancies such as Market To Market values The system is based on Java based Spring architecture This Spectrum has a capability to groups overthecounterOTC trades by portfolio sends those protfolios out for reconciliation and assists portfolio reconciliation operationsPort Rec OPS in reporting and resolving trade breaks that come as part of the reconciliation results The System also helps to provide consistency in process between two counter partiest The Spectrum enables to build Margin UI to provide Port Rec OPS to retrieve OTC result from reconciliation OPS use this UI to track the progress of reconciliation Used UML for developing Use Cases Sequence Diagrams and preliminary Class Diagrams for the system and involved in lowlevel design Extensively used IntelliJ IDE for building testing and deploying applications Developed the whole frame work for the projects based on Spring MVC Developed the presentation layer and GUI framework based on spring framework involving JSP HTML5 JavaScript AJAX CSS Involved in writing JavaScript functions and implementation of AJAX on presentation layer Involved in fixing defects and troubleshooting issues on UNIX environment and wrote Shell scripts to automate jobs Implemented various functions in Unix Shell Scripts as per the internal standards Implement Autosys to schedule Java app Developed various helper classes needed following Core Java multithreaded programming and Collection classes Used multithreading in programming to improve overall performance Apply precommit build continue build and integration build on Jenkins Deploy code on nonproduction environment Trigger regression test and fixed debugs along with testing Product Restful web service with data fetched from DB2 Used JSON and XML formats to transfer data from the server Interact with Restful web service with Angularjs controllers Interact with Jira as project management system which tracing progresses within project Developed controllers repositories Service modules form beans and validations Developed beans and persisted bean in the database using JDBC template and Hibernate Involved in connecting bean with database using Hibernate configuration file Involved in development of Spring DAO layer which invoked database queries Developed Session Beans for the transactions in the application Created SQL queries Stored Procedures Functions for the Database layer by studying the required business objects and validating them with Stored Procedures Also used JPA with Hibernate provider Written Maven scripts to build the entire module and deploy it on Glassfish application Server Implemented monitoring and established best practices around usage of ElasticSearch NoSQL service Build Integration run and deploy code by Jenkins
