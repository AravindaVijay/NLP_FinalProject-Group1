routing software used to optimize routes for 14000 stores being serviced by 2000 merchandisers Handled the geocoding process of store and employee data Corrected thousands of errors produced by geocoding 16000 addresses WebExs were scheduled and hosted with the 28 territory managers Each territory contains 300700 grocery stores and 40 100 employees Fostering a report with the managers was key to the success of the project Modeled the routes using the Vehicle Routing Problem VRP and then optimized the routes using the desired parameters The result was a reduction in mileage less open stores and consistent working hours for the FT field staff Developed a process for determining fulltime routes and parttime routes Jacent Retail was in the process of moving from PT field staff to FT PT It was difficult to accurately predict the working hours a week for each route until a GIS solution was produced Implemented vehicle routing from scratch half a year ahead of schedule and with 1 employee 4 was the suggested minimum The proudest moment of my career was developing a unique solution for a NPhard vehicle routing problem Quality Assurance Administrator Jacent Strategic
