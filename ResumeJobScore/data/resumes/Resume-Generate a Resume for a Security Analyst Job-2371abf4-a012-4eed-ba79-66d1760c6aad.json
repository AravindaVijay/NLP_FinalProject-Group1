Development Testing and Deployment in both Consumer and Enterprise based Applications Expertise in developing Android Application Development using Android Studio as well as various programming languages including Java and Kotlin Executed software projects for automotive industries Experience in using CSM and Cluster hardware Experience in Architecture Design Development and Implementation of Software Applications and Testing Experience in developing various UI components like Text View Customized List View Menus Edit Boxes Checkboxes Dialogs Buttons Status Notifications Action Bars and Spinners Worked on the NDK in addition to SDK to integrate the native code to enhance the performance of CPU intensive operations Worked with Kotlin as it is compatible with JDK 6 and above so apps with Kotlin safely run on older Android versions Some portion of the project was moved to Kotlin for an efficient and lighter standard of coding Collaborate with Product Designers and Product Managers to deliver compelling consumerfacing products on the Android Platform Strong knowledge on MVVM pattern that there need to be no code behind within the view Strong experience with Android Framework APIs such as Google Maps Camera Resource Manager Fragments Location Manager Notification Manager Content Providers Contact Manager CAN LIN Telephony API and REST APIs Experience in using JDBC for connecting to database for data exchange and retrieval Strong knowledge in MVP pattern Android SDK Webservices JSON Android Studio SQLite database Activities Services Broadcast Receivers UI Designing

Android Developer General Motors Warren MI May 2017 to June 2019 Description Worked as an Android Developer for GM infotainment systems Deployed Trailering Application which is a core app for the Trucks in the GM fleet such as Cadillac Chevrolet and GMC Which enables the user to check temperature of the trailer and creating multiple profiles for the user and it has different checklist for daily usage of trailer and it was implemented with all the features available for the trailer and the app was released in USA CA and MX Countries supporting English French and Spanish Responsibilities Worked on OEM applications which built for customized Android displays Participated in complete Software Development Life Cycle SDLC for proper analysis development of reusable code testing and enhancement of the code Working on different key components of android like app life cycles broadcast receivers content providers services Developing AIDL for IPC between the applications Worked on Center Stack Module and Cluster Worked on Kotlin as it provides Java language interoperability This is a design that allows Kotlin code to transparently call Java language methods coupled with annotations that make it easy to expose Kotlinonly functionality to Java code Worked on Kotlin files that dont use any Kotlinspecific semantics can be directly referenced from Java code without any annotations at all Worked with MVVM as ViewModel is the main point of MVVM application so that view can placed that information on the screen Managing Jenkins for Continuously integrating application development Developed and maintained custom android libraries for integrating with multiple applications Designed and developed UI using fragments and activities and UX using material design features like Navigation Drawer Floating Button Coordinator layout  Recyclerview for easy navigation and better user experience Developed Memory leak detecting feature using Leakcanary Implemented efficient ProGuard rules for shrinking the size of APK which saves data during OTA updates Participated in Agile methodology Scrum for project implementation Writing Gradle scripts for projects as required Used GIT for code repository and maintaining current and historical versions of the source code Used Retrofit to retrieve and upload JSON through a Restful webservices Used Android SDK and Eclipse IDE for development Participated in vehicle testing Worked on JIRA and TFS to track the current sprint and create assign tasks Implemented different versions of same application to run on different configurations of Infotainment systems as customer build with his own configuration Optimized the UI to make the layouts reusable by showing or hiding a few views using frame layouts using fragments
