in their refinery The system also monitored temperature pressure and vibration of various machines within the refinery and as part of a comprehensive solution provided predictive modeling on the performance and maintenance of the machine components The predictive analytical model employs parStream database technology to manage huge amounts of information transmitted from sensors on these machines Much of this data is consumed by a web application that provided near realtime statistics on the monitoring and reporting on the safety and maintenance of the refinery infrastructure As technical lead for this project I was responsible for the development of the initial UI mockup while working with the project manager and customer team in Singapore to gather requirements and translate them into development tasks Requirements and tasks are tracked using the Rally tool I coordinated all requirements with an external development team DG Logik contracted to building the UI

the end user but behind the scenes much of the original designcode was still in play with data sources geographically scattered at various remote locations The Web frontend applications were written in jQuery JavaScript HTML CSS and Ember and communicated with the backend services through a RESTAJAX interface using JSON and XML as the data transport The backend applications were written in Perl and PHP with data accessed remotely via SOAP messages and locally via queries to MySQL and Oracle databases GIT was used for source control and tasks were managed in an agilelike environment Software
