tracking the status of a payment transaction through the payment cycle 2 Internal Interface 3 This part of the solution consists of an admin screen for our collections team It lets them see what stage of the payment process a transaction is on submitted rejected incollections etc 4 In addition the collections team can update and resubmit a transaction view NACHA processing 5 Client Interface 6 This part of the solution allows our client to view their transactions any notes our collection team has entered view requests from the collections team and reverse a transaction in their system The information is synchronized via API calls 1 CHANGE OF INFO REQUEST APPLICATION This solution is a web application service utilized by multiple applications to collect reviewand approvereject COI requests from the end user Related components are 2 End User Interface 3 Integrates with existing web applications via client side packaged library to locate user account information Provides a request form which is submitted to the web service 4 Admin Console 5 Provides a web interface for clerks to review and process COI requests Interfaces with COI application via packaged library which provides authentication authorization services for logged in users managed by a token based system 1 IVR SYSTEM INTEGRATION Developed an interactive voice response system using a third party service to provide phone payment solutions to our clients 2 Created an API which the IVR system uses to look up account and account balance information 3 Created an API which accepts payment account information and creates a payment order for the requested amounts 4 IVR after confirmation then submits payment 1 TASK SCHEUDLER Executes Java or SQL jobs as configured by the user Provides user interface to administer scheduled jobs and view job results logs 2 Utilizes Java threads to execute concurrent scheduled jobs 3 Two packages are available for this solution core and web 4 The core package includes all the essential functionality to manually schedule and run a scheduled job 5 The web component is a Web Fragment Project jar which provides the optional web admin interface Implemented as a single HTML tag 6 Messaging System Provides messaging solutions for inhouse applications 7 Integrates with the Task Scheduler listed above to prepare and send queued messages 8 Provides a templating system for custom message presentation 9 Provides message delivery failure notifications to administrators 10 Supports email and SMS notifications 11 BILLING SOLUTION PAYMENT AND

essentially backtracking all records created in the system for any given transaction 17 REPORTING SYSTEM Global reporting system Currently implemented as a task management reporting solution 18 Can be configured to a specific data source and can report on multiple columns tables 19 Supports multiple levels of reporting aggregation by specified columns recursive Additional Information SKILLS The skills I have attained have been gained through employment as a full stack developer at a fast paced company where I develop enterprise level applications for the public sector Through my current role I have gained the skills necessary to develop systems that focus on account management ie the effective management and presentation of customer data and payment processing The latter of which deals with CPI and the related protocols for the transfer of money from point A to point B The applications I have developed are consumer facing account management ecommerce applications built around a central payment processing system These applications enable our clients to manage customer account data provide account status collect payment and mitigate returned transaction through collection efforts In addition I have developed internal applications that qualify as support applications dedicated to the preparationmigration of data for the main application to consume Some of the products I have worked on include a tax management system a public utility account management system a probation reporting system an overthecounter cashier system and a transaction management system These applications must manage all client data and allow their customers to process payments I work in development test and production environments and have taken projects through the full application

skills I have attained have been gained through employment as a full stack developer at a fast paced company where I develop enterprise level applications for the public sector Through my current role I have gained the skills necessary to develop systems that focus on account management ie the effective management and presentation of customer data and payment processing The latter of which deals with CPI and the related protocols for the transfer of money from point A to point B The applications I have developed are consumer facing account management ecommerce applications built around a central payment processing system These applications enable our clients to manage customer account data provide account status collect payment and mitigate returned transaction through collection efforts In addition I have developed internal applications that qualify as support applications dedicated to the preparationmigration of data for the main application to consume Some of the products I have worked on include a tax management system a public utility account management system a probation reporting system an overthecounter cashier system and a transaction management system These applications must manage all client data and allow their customers to process payments I work in development test and production environments and have taken projects through the full application development life cycle Some of the technologies I work with include Java J2EE Java Naming and Directory Interface JNDI Java Server Faces SOAP and REST APIs Struts JavaScript HTML 5 CSS IBM DB2 AS400
