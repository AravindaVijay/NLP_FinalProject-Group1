building and data center performance Administered SharePoint Site Created maintained updated SharePoint Site both public facing and private service area for data center related information dissemination and situational awareness Formulated Preventive Maintenance Schedules for the enterprise data centers Identified single points of failure within each facilities MEP and controls Coordinated outage schedule with an awareness of maintenance needs driven by single points of failure Utilized scheduled outage windows to include upgrades enhancements as well as retrocommissioning Reduced unplanned outages Improved data center efficiency reliability and performance Projects Teamed with Plant Engineering to upgrade Data Center B CRACs Upgraded to variable speed fans with remote cold aisle sensors utilizing Lieberts iCOM Optimized Aisle Control Positioned sensors to maximize failover protection Leveraged NEO DCIM for data trending Compiled and analyzed performance data adjusted and tuned Saved 100 kWH from mechanical load greatly reducing cost while improving performance and reliability Conceived and executed plan to add new ATS and generator docking station to the Data Center A power grid New docking station allowed for generator diversity a secondary rollup generator may be brought online to supplement the primary Next year testing exposed significant issues requiring extensive downtime to remediate The new ATS and docking station allowed the datacenter to remain online and protected Partnered with Plant Engineering to specify and select replacement of dualredundant chillers for Data Center C Conceptualized a 2Phase plan Phase1 Install electrical and glycol hitching post in singular outage to facilitate rollup chiller Phase2 nondisruptive one at a
