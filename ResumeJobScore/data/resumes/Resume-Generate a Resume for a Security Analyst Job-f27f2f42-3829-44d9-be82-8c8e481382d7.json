Administrator in JIRA and CHALK IT PROJECT MANAGER COORDINATOR ADAMS 12 FIVE STAR SCHOOLS July 2018 to March 2019 Considered the onsite IT PM and Coordinator which is hardware ITbased This includes having an electrical understanding troubleshooting experience and knowledge base of current technology and options for schools With my technical expertise part of my collaboration with schools includes onsite troubleshooting and teacher enduser training which provides highlevel training to familiarize teachers with their new classroom technology Works with many internal departments maintaining relationships and implementing the appropriate departments or crew to accomplish project milestones and schedule Some of these internal stakeholders include IT field team and system administrators purchasing finance warehouse engineers electrical and infrastructure and departmental managers Some of the other internal stakeholders that are maintained with this IT project is teachers and Principals Maintaining relationships and providing customer service to individual schools within the district and providing initial estimates budget and expertise for technology in classrooms and hold meetings to this effect Meetings and outreach continue even after leaving a site to maintain relationships issues log and contingency spending Provide electrical placement power pulls outlet location and wall types for the new technology Based on the initial walk through I create maps in AutoCad for projector electrical and equipment locations This is also in collaboration with an Ethernet project that pull Ethernet to projector and security camera projects Different projects and PMs collaborating together to accomplish different Bond projects As an onsite PM I often do run through school walks with vendor electricians construction crew and IT AV tech installers Meeting with all stakeholders and communicating project requirements to meet project milestones and deadlines This includes conducting project meetings and providing expert advice A big part of my role within the instructional upgrade project is handling vendor selections This includes qualifying vendors to work with the district placing vendor bids gathering quotes seller response and awarding to the lowest bidder I do create vendor qualifying matrixs review boards and contracts Much of what I do is reviewed and edited An even bigger part of my role as the onsite PM is to maintain the vendor relationships monitor and vendor coordination awarding and creating scope of work When questions arise onsite alongside with constructional issues I am the first point of contact for vendors to make quick decisions that are in accordance with building code Create network designs using Microsoft

assigned to various clean up tasks one of them being purchase orders had entailed touching base with implementers finance clients and other managers to effectively and efficiently coordinate projects and purchase order completion milestones In this purchase order cleanup project 101 purchase orders have been reduced significantly and maintained at 60 opened orders This was done in merely a sixmonth period and within budget saving the company time and money while maintaining client satisfaction Meet and monitor project deadlines in a largescale environment This means working with other departments and stakeholders with technical and nontechnical expertise in a project teamoriented environment Working in the local government division I have worked with over 100 clients to effectively communicate network and hardware capabilities to make milestone goals in a professional manner Work within a corporate setting that follow professional project management methods by following the best practices and tools for project execution and management Another cleanup project I was assigned to was for our Changepoint management system detailed best used project management practices in closing about 30 opened projects that were backlogged Saved Tyler time and materials with projects opened since 2011 while also saving customer loyalty AVIONIC ELECTRICAL TECHNITION US Navy July 2011 to July 2015 Troubleshoot computer systems software Such as RADAR ATFLIR communication and telecommunication systems and weapons systems Where multitasking and prioritization was a must Often wrote junior enlisted awards evaluations and brag sheets which helped advance their careers This required excellent verbal and written communicative skills Have trained 16 personnel 12 of which have successfully completed required electrical apprenticeship and allowed 4 of which advanced in rank Often worked with diverse groups in teams and networked with other shops in professional business applications where it was necessary to nurture relationships between crossfunctional teams A fighter jet was giving various cautions to multiple systems electrical and nonelectrical Together working with other departments we brought up a fighter jet not safe for flight There was an allotted a time to repair issues and saving the military on a multimilliondollar downed aircraft Had to make quick and sound ethical and commonsense decisions for incrisis situations This also includes problem solving abilities where I had to mitigate software hardware and network issues in a fastpaced working environment requiring high attention to detail Gained skills in leadership where I had to demonstrate crossfunctional leadership To lead a team required top organizational skills where workload needed to be mitigated planned and scheduled to be completed After working with a junior technician we fabricated a new video line necessary to be displayed on a computer system screen The discrepancy was completed within allotted 5hour window and saving 30300 dollars in flight time for mission readiness Often worked independently as a resident electrical expert and headed many shop tasks As
