well as caching on query Used XML to transfer the application data between client and server In serverside Servlets is used to construct and parse the data in XML format and in clientside Java is used Created logical and physical data models putting to practice concepts of normalization and RDBMS Log4J was used for logging and to capture the log that includes runtime exceptions Involved in deployment of the Application on Web Sphere Application Server Used SVN for project management and version management Involved in Unit integration bug fixing and acceptance testing with test cases Environment CoreJava J2EE JSP Struts Servlets Spring Hibernate JDBC Oracle 8i AJAX XML ANT Junit CVS Maven and JBossApplicationServer Software Engineer Microchip Technologies September 2011 to November 2012 Roles Responsibilities Used agile methodology for developing the application Developed using new features of Java 15 like Annotations Generics enhanced for loop and Enums Developed various generic JavaScript functions used for validations Developed screens using JSP JavaScript HTML and CSS Developed Web Services clients to consume those Web Services as well other enterprise wide Web Services Created DDL and DML SQL scripts for creation of database objects Created logical and physical data models putting to practice concepts of normalization and RDBMS Created and injected Spring services Spring controllers and DAOs to achieve dependencyinjectionand to wire objects of business classes Used Core JavaDesign Patterns like Singleton Factory MVC Intercepting Filter Front Controller Business Delegate Service Locator Session Facade and DAO Designed and implemented Struts MVC Paradigm components such as Action Mapping Action class Dispatch action class Action Form bean and a form set for validation and used JavaBeans to return dynamic information Used Spring Inheritance to develop beans from already developed parent beans Used JSF framework in developing user interfaces using JSF UI Components Worked in all the modules of the application which involved frontend presentation logic developed using Tiles JSP JSTL and java script XML Business objects developed using POJOs and data access layer using Hibernate Involved in configuring Hibernate mapping files and POJO objects Involved in writing Thread Safe blocks for multithread access to make valid transactions Exposed the Web Services to the client applications by sharing the WSDLs Database development required creation of new tables PLSQL stored procedures functions views indexes and constraints triggers and required SQL tuning to reduce the response time in the application Environment Spring Hibernate PLSQL HTML CSS JSP JavaScript POJO DAO MVC JST XML JSF Java 15 JavaBeans
