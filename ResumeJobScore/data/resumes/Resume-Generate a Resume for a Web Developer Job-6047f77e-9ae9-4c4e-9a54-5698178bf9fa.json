University of Washington Medical Center focusing on Biomedical Informatics With prior degrees in Biology and Computer Science over eight years of experience as a data analyst and eighteen years of experience as a software developer I am seeking a position where I can utilize my skills in statistical analysis and software engineering to further research and application of Bioinformatics Highlights of Qualifications Mining of highthroughput gene expression data including microarray and RNAseq data to identify pathwaybased transcriptomic changes Familiarity to statistical analysis of nextgeneration sequencing data Tackling of statistical issues arising from high dimensionality high data heterogeneity and small sample sizes Deep understanding and lab research experience in molecular biology especially cancer biology Machine learning prediction of patient outcomes using clinical and electronic health data Extensive background in design and implementation of software applications by following the best practices of the IT industry Proficiency in R Python MATLAB SQL Java Net C JavaScript JQuery HTML5 etc Considerable experience in relational databases design and management of data including health care data Development of research ideas through independent research and interpersonal discussions Experience in Microsoft Azure cloud computing service Working knowledge with AWS Comfortable with highpaced settings and multitasking requirements Highly motivated and detail oriented Work Experience postdoctoral fellow Department of Anesthesiology Pain Medicine University of Washington Medical Center Seattle WA December 2018 to Present Key projects and accomplishments Prediction for traumatic brain injury TBI patient outcomes to prevent secondary insults using a variety of machine learning techniques including treebased methods and deep learning The prediction is done by classifying whether hypotension andor hypocarbia would occur during surgery This project is funded by an NIH R21 grant Translating biclusters into gene networks based on probabilistic graphical models Biclusters identified by mining multiple gene expression datasets provide highconfidence information on intergene correlations which can be used to build either directed or undirected acyclic graphs The resulting graphs can provide insights into how genes are regulated and potentially aid in patient diagnosis and drug design Programming of a new Departmental Income Distribution Plan that involves sophisticated calculations and integration of different data sources The plan is now in effect with an expected result to provide better incentive to the anaesthesia providers I am honored to have received praises from the departmental management please see Appendix B for

BiclusterBased Identification of Gene Sets from Gene Expression Data through Multivariate MetaAnalysis MVMA Abstract Highthroughput technologies have led to production of massive amount of biological data Much of the data has been made publicly available but remains underutilized The current study aims to uncovering functional gene sets by mining cancerrelated public gene expression data The challenges of using public data include high dimensionality considerable heterogeneity and small sample sizes The technique of biclustering is first employed to identify bicluster patterns from selected datasets The individual biclusters are then integrated to combine the evidence of the embedded gene sets through multivariate metaanalysis MVMA Despite the widespread use of MVMA in clinical data we show it is unpractical to directly apply the traditional MVMA methods whether based on the Bayesian or the frequentist framework to analysis of highdimensional and small samplesize data To adapt MVMA to public expression data a number of novel strategies were designed and evaluated one of them being a sparse estimate of the weighted betweenstudy covariance matrix With this procedure we are able to achieve favorable recall and precision in pattern recognition while maintaining a high efficiency in computation time The candidate gene sets that are statistically significant are validated using knowledgebased pathway analyses The developed approach has led to a large number of gene sets uncovered that show promise of functional relevance for various cancer types Furthermore a statistic of the gene sets is found to be correlated with the levels of functional relevance allowing screening of the candidate gene sets prior to the downstream analyses The study has two key contributions 1 it adapts the MVMA framework to analysis of highdimensional and small samplesize public expression data to identify gene sets undergoing transcriptomic changes 2 It discovers a statistic associated with candidate gene sets that is predictive of the levels of biological relevance A manuscript is currently being prepared for publication Appendix B Praises for my work in

BiclusterBased Identification of Gene Sets from Gene Expression Data through Multivariate MetaAnalysis MVMA Abstract Highthroughput technologies have led to production of massive amount of biological data Much of the data has been made publicly available but remains underutilized The current study aims to uncovering functional gene sets by mining cancerrelated public gene expression data The challenges of using public data include high dimensionality considerable heterogeneity and small sample sizes The technique of biclustering is first employed to identify bicluster patterns from selected datasets The individual biclusters are then integrated to combine the evidence of the embedded gene sets through multivariate metaanalysis MVMA Despite the widespread use of MVMA in clinical data we show it is unpractical to directly apply the traditional MVMA methods whether based on the Bayesian or the frequentist framework to analysis of highdimensional and small samplesize data To adapt MVMA to public expression data a number of novel strategies were designed and evaluated one of them being a sparse estimate of the weighted betweenstudy covariance matrix With this procedure we are able to achieve favorable recall and precision in pattern recognition while maintaining a high efficiency in computation time The candidate gene sets that are statistically significant are validated using knowledgebased pathway analyses The developed approach has led to a large number of gene sets uncovered that show promise of functional relevance for various cancer types Furthermore a statistic of the gene sets is found to be correlated with the levels of functional relevance allowing screening of the candidate gene sets prior to the downstream analyses The study has two key contributions 1 it adapts the MVMA framework to analysis of highdimensional and small samplesize public expression data to identify gene sets undergoing transcriptomic changes 2 It discovers a statistic associated with candidate gene sets that is predictive of the levels of biological relevance A manuscript is currently being prepared for publication Appendix B Praises for my work in
