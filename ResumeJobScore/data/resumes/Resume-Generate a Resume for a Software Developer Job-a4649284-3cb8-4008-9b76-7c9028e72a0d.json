company to build a new data warehouse on a data warehouse project 1 Work with business analyst client manager and business users of the data warehouse to define the data warehouse scope define data elements choose data source as well as refine the supertype structure of the data warehouse 2 Using ERWIN to design the concept model and discuss with all the party to get consensus on it 3 Using ERWIN to design the logical model with close working relationship with business analyst having numerous meetings and discussions with client to understand the data flow of the source data refined data model to suit all partys need 4 Constructing the physical data model and writing the document regard to the star schema logic for data warehouse design 5 Using Oracle warehouse builder 92028 to design ETL process installed the client side OWB and server side OWB finished the necessary configuration for the OWB like design repository and runtime repository install metadata browser configuration 6 Wrote the data mapping sheet to map the source data element to the target element 7 Design the data load mapping by using OWB for ETL the data to the data warehouse table 8 Design the process flow for data flowing from source to target Use Oracle workflow and OEM to schedule the data flushing time table Senior Database Consultant Cap Gemini Inc February 2001 to November 2002 Information Technology
