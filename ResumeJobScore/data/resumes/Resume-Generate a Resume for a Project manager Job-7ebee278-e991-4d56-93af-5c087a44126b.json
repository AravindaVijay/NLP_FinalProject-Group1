based solution which provides the total content in a lowcost distributed environment The FLX platform dynamically aggregates the content from four major Global Distribution SystemsGDS The four key audiences for Farelogix are Travel Supppliers Travel Sellers Travel Buyers and Travel Site Search engines Travel agents use the FLX platform to source the travel content against infinite number of suppliers Responsibilities Involved in several phases of RUP such as inception elaboration contruction for the software development of the travel industries which use Farelogix FLX platform for the acquisition of data Implemented the application using the concrete principles laid down by several design patterns such as MVC Business Delegate Service Locator Data Access Object Singleton and Factory Developed user interface on Jakarta Struts Framework using JSP and HTML Configured the Struts Framework by providing the mappings for the Action Classes Form Beans in the strutsconfigxml file Used JSP Struts tag libraries and Jakarta Struts Tags for implementing the user views Used various Custom Spring DAOs in order to retrieve the records from suitable tables in the database Implemented Hibernate and configured it to store the persistent data as an ObjectRelational Mapping ORM tool for communicating with database Implemented Dependency Injection feature of Spring Framework integrated into Struts Frame work with Hibernate Used Java Messaging Services JMS for reliable and asynchronous exchange of important information such as payment status report with a Queue as destination Used MDBs for processing the status reports Developed new interfaces using Java to the different airlines and car rental business partners Used Java Script and XSLT on the XML file to convert an XML file
