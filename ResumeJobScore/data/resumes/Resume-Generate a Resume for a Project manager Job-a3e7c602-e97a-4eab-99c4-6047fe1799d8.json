in architecture of application I proposed and used WCF and Web API separated layers to increase performance and security We can added server resources at both layers under load balancer Created entity classes by Entity Framework 63 for data access layer with code first approach Build WCF services and separated proxy project for clients to avoid source control complexity ASPNET MVC5 is main project template Implemented generate repository patterns along with unit of work Used ASYNC methods for performance Used Automapper tool for conversion of type in each layers I used Ninject as DI container to loosely couple of layers and archive for NUNIT testing All services were covered with test case methods At UI side I used Angular 13 and Kendo UI along with bootstrap There were multiple single pages and handled by Aspnet MVC route as well angular routing module Created angular directives as building blocks and increase reusability and maintainability Used angular custom services across persisting data for controllers For AJAX request I used both http service as well ngresources I used bootstrap container and grid system for formatting layout and getting responsive design

Castle Winsor as DI container All Backend services classes handler classes has respective test class and practice Test Driven Development TDD I used MVC4 as framework Web Project and outputs are HTML files Used default custom binding to get model Used JQuery promise object to get ordered of synchronous calls and eliminated callback hell Lead NET Infrastructure developer New York University Medical Center November 2007 to May 2011 Build and maintained custom tool named ADAPT Tool using JavaScript C ASPNET Active Directory MS SQL DB and Oracle This custom tool is for automating a work flow For example when user join to organization it can create user account at active directory mail box at evenly distributed exchange servers using POWER SHELL and legacy COM component When user get terminated it can disable Active Directory user accounts and mailboxes moved AD accounts to a disabled OUOrganizational Unit Implemented a process using window service to permenently delete AD Users mailbox in exchange All operations were logged to database files window events log So can easily recover AD objects from logs Education MS in Computer Science The City College City University of New
