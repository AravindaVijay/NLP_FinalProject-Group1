Pradesh July 2012 M S in Computer Science Southern Methodist University Dallas TX Additional Information CURRICULUM PROJETCS Account Tracker This Android application allows user to keep track of different bank accounts held by a user and the transactions in those accounts Created an android application using EclipseADT to manage multiple bank account transactions using a single application Studied and implemented different storage mechanisms and some advanced packages like text to speech map view in android system Wireless Sensor Networks A wireless sensor network WSN is a collection of nodes organized into a cooperative network The nodes communicate wirelessly and they could be distributed in random way so we can see the nodes as vertices and the connection as edges in a random geometric graph In this project we implement an algorithm for determining a coloring terminal clique and a selection of bipartite subgraphs that are produced by an algorithm for graph coloring in a random geometric Graph RGG These results model is a wireless sensor network WSN with each bipartite subgraph providing a communication backbone Implemented using java plugin language called Processing Attendance and Examination Automation System AEAS Colleges in India have a separate department for conducting examinations for students across all departments This AEAS system was designed for the department to automate student attendance and run reports Created a Content Management System CMS using JSP PHP HTMLCSS staff can easily make updates and maintain records My module of work is to work on security front end design and building database for the system Employee Email System Upgrade for APGenco APGenco is the biggest thermal power supplier in the state of Andhra Pradesh India They had a very old legacy system for employees to mail each other In this project we replaced the legacy system with a better and improved system which has addons like chat box large file share etc The new system was more secure and supported document attachments which were a huge benefit to the end users My module of work is mainly concentrated on handling requirement gathering sessions building up a
