up written in c using opengl for portability Takes advantage of vector architectures to increase speed for floating point calculations Still currently a WIP Intelius Search Screen Scraper to Streamline efficiency The Realtors were manually pulling information from a website exporting to excel and then manually inputting that data into Intelius premiere This program automated all of that increasing their efficiency and doing a days worth of work in less than a quarter of the time by interfacing with a dom modelin vb to create a bot that connected to Intelius premiere logged in went through contacts in Excel and scrape their information one bye one Sparc Assemble r Written in Java and Cup Wrote a Parser and compiler that would break down C code into Sparcv9 instructions and run them on a Solaris Machine Supported procedures structures pointers references global variables printf as well as arithmetic functionsincluding floats LinkedIn Search Linkedin public and Linkedin
