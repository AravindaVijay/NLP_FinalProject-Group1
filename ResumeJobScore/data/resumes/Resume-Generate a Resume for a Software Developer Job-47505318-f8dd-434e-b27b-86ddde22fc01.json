notice ended this functionality was removed Beach Erosion Monitoring httpsgisdhecscgovbermexplorer Web application to provide the public information on OCRM beach erosion monitoring Erosion data is collected annually along transects associated with survey monuments 3k points per monument The application allows the user to quickly plot the elevation and bathymetry data to generate an elevation

volume spatial extent etc It is updated as renourishment projects are completed Beach Access and Water Quality httpsgisdhecscgovbeachaccess Web application to allow the public to quickly locate public beach access locations based on proximity and amenities The application also reports realtime data and status for water quality monitoring stations along the beachfront Coastal Hazard Vulnerability Assessment httpsgisdhecscgovhva Web application to present the results of the OCRM Hazard Vulnerability Assessment which involved the examination of shoreline change storm surge flooding and social vulnerability data Hurricane Matthew Map Tour httpsgisdhecscgovmatthew_photos Immediately following Hurricane Matthew DHEC participated in a beachfront damage assessment flight to triage beachfront impacts and focus response activities Certain photos from the flight were selected and used to develop a map tour to provide the public a glimpse into the impacts along the beachfront Coastal Zone Boundary Analysis httpwwwscdhecgovHomeAndEnvironmentDocsDHEC_CZBoundary_Studypdf The SC General Assembly instructed to DHEC to examine the current Coastal Zone boundary The boundary was established during the adoption of the Coastal Management Program in accordance with federal and state guidelines The SC boundary was established in a geopolitical manner by county boundary The study was requested to determine if there was a better way to establish the boundary based on environmental factors rather than political boundaries The study required intensive GISbased examination of coastal environmental variables such as estuarine habitat saltwater and salt marsh tidal influence flooding sea level rise endangered species and species habitats water quality cultural resources protections and designations and watersheds Not all components were used in the final analysis but all were examined to determine the methodology to be used to conduct the study Marsh Island Study httpsscelporgpostsview138 Marsh islands are small upland hummocks within salt marsh areas that typically cannot be accessed without bridge or boat Regulations written in the early 1990s governed access to these islands In 2005 the SC Supreme Court deemed regulations regarding access to marsh islands too vague DHEC convened an advisory committee to study the issue and formulate recommendations for new regulation In support of the advisory committee intense examination of the over 3500 marsh islands analyzing and classifying them by size and distance from upland using various parameters and thresholds was conducted In the end results from the analysis were used by the committee to recommend guidelines for a new regulation BerkeleyDorchester County Boundary Change New Zoning httpsgisberkeleycountyscgovmapsnew_zoning The position of the BerkeleyDorchester county boundary was corrected in 2018 As a result a large portion of what had been Dorchester County became part of Berkeley County As such new zoning designations for the newly acquired parcels had to be adopted This web application was designed to inform new Berkeley County citizens of their new property zoning and provide details about those designations",

States beachfront jurisdiction Searchable by address and parcel Data and reports available for viewing and download During the public notice period for the new lines the application also provided direct access the permitting system Public Comment interface Searches and map clicks determined the relevant beach area and routed the user to the appropriate public notice interface After public notice ended this functionality was removed Beach Erosion Monitoring httpsgisdhecscgovbermexplorer Web application to provide the public information on OCRM beach erosion monitoring Erosion data is collected annually along transects associated with survey monuments 3k points per monument The application allows the user to quickly plot the elevation and bathymetry data to generate an elevation profile Monitoring data is downloadable Beach Renourishment httpsgisdhecscgovrenourishment Web application to provide to the public information on past beach renourishment projects including cost sand volume spatial extent etc It is updated as renourishment projects are completed Beach Access and Water Quality httpsgisdhecscgovbeachaccess Web application to allow the public to quickly locate public beach access locations based on proximity and amenities The application also reports realtime data and status for water quality monitoring stations along the beachfront Coastal Hazard Vulnerability Assessment httpsgisdhecscgovhva Web application to present the results of the OCRM Hazard Vulnerability Assessment which involved the examination of shoreline change storm surge flooding and social vulnerability data Hurricane Matthew Map Tour httpsgisdhecscgovmatthew_photos Immediately following Hurricane Matthew DHEC participated in a beachfront damage assessment flight to triage beachfront impacts and focus response activities Certain photos from the flight were selected and used to develop a map tour to provide the public a glimpse into the impacts along the beachfront Coastal Zone Boundary Analysis httpwwwscdhecgovHomeAndEnvironmentDocsDHEC_CZBoundary_Studypdf The SC General Assembly instructed to DHEC to examine the current Coastal Zone boundary The boundary was established during the adoption of the Coastal Management Program in accordance with federal and state guidelines The SC boundary was established in a geopolitical manner by county boundary The study was requested to determine if there was a better way to establish the boundary based on environmental factors rather than political boundaries The study required intensive GISbased examination of coastal environmental variables such as estuarine habitat saltwater and salt marsh tidal influence flooding sea level rise endangered species and species habitats water quality cultural resources protections and designations and watersheds Not all components were used in the final analysis but all were examined to determine the methodology to be used to conduct the study Marsh Island Study httpsscelporgpostsview138 Marsh islands are small upland hummocks within salt marsh areas that typically cannot be accessed without bridge or boat Regulations written in the early 1990s governed access to these islands In 2005 the SC Supreme Court deemed regulations regarding access to marsh islands too vague DHEC convened an advisory committee to study the issue and formulate recommendations for new regulation In support of the advisory committee intense examination of the over 3500 marsh islands analyzing and classifying them by size and distance from upland using various parameters and thresholds was conducted In the end results from the analysis were used by the committee to recommend guidelines for a new regulation BerkeleyDorchester County Boundary Change New Zoning httpsgisberkeleycountyscgovmapsnew_zoning The position of the BerkeleyDorchester county boundary was corrected in 2018 As a result a large portion of what had been Dorchester County became part of Berkeley County As such new zoning designations for the newly acquired parcels had to be adopted This web application was designed to inform new Berkeley County citizens of their new property zoning and provide details about those designations",
