Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Data DeveloperPower BI Admin Parsley Energy Austin TX August 2017 to Present Providing adhoc reports and solutions to the business based on the business user request involving data of various type schema and size Involved in modernizing our current data integration model for detailed troubleshooting during daily agent job load failuredowntime Optimizing our current data warehouse infrastructure to accommodate new business user demands and requests Implementations of modern tools and software for a swift response to business user request and also establishing an efficient adoption and transition process an example was the implementation of Enerhub a Master Data Management tool from Stone Bridge late last year to help bridge the gap between the data custodian and the data Steward thereby fostering accountability between both parties within the organisation Automate preexisting manual processes with data related solutions leveraging scripting languages precisely Power Shell and C to free up bandwidth resources for the business Managed and supervised data migration processes from various EDM software across systems and consolidated this data in the data warehouse was also involved in software upgrade processes Implementation of Power BI Snowflake Data warehouse JAMS Scheduler and Informatica Cloud Enterprise solution software to help modernize our preexisting data architecture infrastructure Implemented and scheduled Salesforce data synchronization packages with Informatica Integration tool leveraging API connectors and JAMS scheduler Implemented incremental Integration job load with Informatica Cloud Enterprise service cutting down Scheduled jobs load time by 75 from previous full Load Integration with SSIS Participated in standing up JAMS scheduler and migrating the bulk of our SQL agent jobs to JAMS Set up our companys Power BI gateway cluster for both Test and Production servers created and segmented various AD groups based on permission access and database Optimized our current Cube processing load time by implementing a dynamic cube partition based on Months for SSAS reducing downtime by cutting the prior processing time from 2hrs to 35min Implemented Tabular data model which uses columnar storage for compression for our SSAS server Instance for optimized reporting I was part of the MS Azure data warehouse evaluating and implementation team shifting from snowflakes datawarehouse based on my experience in connecting to the cloud ecosystem for reporting Implemented Replication ODS load for our company EDM database architecture moving from the typical Batch ODS which eventually entirely eliminating downtime related to the ODS layer integration jobs Created stored procedures and triggers based on business needs to help facilitate their data delivery process Created calculated fields in SSAS cube using MDX language and in Power BI using DAX when we eventually went tabular based on business user requirement and leveraging the CRISPDM methodology for data mining Partook in SOX training to be able to liaise with Auditors to ensure at any given point in time our company procedures are compliant with industry standards and regulation I have been able to successfully troubleshoot concurrent job failures within stringent timeframes and tensed environment while making amends moving forward in order to be more proactive as opposed to reactive the RODS implementation mentioned earlier is an example that completely eliminated job failures related to batch load Data AnalystBusiness AnalystTableau Developer Schlumberger PLC Houston TX February 2015 to July 2017 Gathered user requirements analyzed and designed software solution based on the user requests Access and transform massive data sets through filtering grouping aggregation and statistical calculation Involved in creating database objects like tables views procedures triggers

while also limiting the access and interference using versioning tools Schemabinding and Encryption Create Optimized Adhoc queries using Hints to leverage the best execution plan Use profiler tracing and tuning advisor to improve SQL server performance Use SQL auditing feature and other methods like DML triggers and DDL triggers to perform auditing in capturing real time events Create triggers for consistency and correspondence in input and output transaction Also implementing the best Isolation plan for each individual transaction Troubleshoot a server instance or database in the case of poor or slow performance Resolve Transaction concurrency issues using the best necessary isolation strategy Resolve Deadlock issues in concurrent transactions by assigning a deadlock victim and rolling back the affected transaction for consistency and discerning when to take an atomic approach and kill a session without losing any database resource Implement most of the high availability solutions
