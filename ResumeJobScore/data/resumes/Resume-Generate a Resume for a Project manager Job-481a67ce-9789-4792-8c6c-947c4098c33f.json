all about organic and natural products Organic products with those regular ones the same way the look of website and its feel contributes a lot to the buyers who come online on our organic product store Responsibilities Worked on Software Development Life cycle SDLC starting from Requirements gathering and performing objectoriented analysis design implementation and development using Agile methodology with daily scrums Using Visual Studio 2016 I worked on a realtime inventory management mobile application In this application I was responsible to work for one module that is field officer Responsible to design the database for the field officer module using SQL SERVER Also prepare the stored procedures Used NET MVC architectural pattern by diving the application in 3 parts C for the backend functionalities SQL for the databases and integrated 3rd party WEB API for the interface between desktop and mobile application Developed the application using NTier architecture using MVC 5 Entity Framework 56 LINQ Web API HTML5 CSS3 Angular 2 Typescript and Bootstrap UI Used Dependency injection for injecting various Angular services to Angular Controllers to enable AJAX calls Also Implemented Angular 2 Services to bind the data and provide access to the data on the server Designed new interface screens and implemented application logic under ASPNET MVC and effectively created custom routes and added them to ASPNET MVC routes collection Responsible for designing and developing the UI using Bootstrap HTML5 CSS3 Angular 2 Created Typescript reusable components and services to consume REST APIs using Component based architecture provided by Angular 2 Developed the clientside views on angular 2 and typescript CreatedModified Angular 20 components by using Typescript we create the bigger projects and converts to JS files to modify or creating new JS files Worked with JQuery and typescript for the development of the UI Used Entity Frameworks Code First approach to create database and tables as objects along with LINQ to handle the communication with the database and to perform CRUD operations Created various RESTful services using WEB API to return serialized JSON data which are later consumed through Angular 2 services Created various web Services WCF services and consumed those services from the client UI by adding web reference for the services Created and maintained database schema tables views stored procedures and indexes for better performance using SQL Server Developed reports using complex formulas and to query the database to generate different types of adhoc reports using SSRS Utilized the TFS source control software to keep track of new and past versions of code written in my application Involved in working on test driven

mobile application for which my team was responsible for handling the admin panel Roles Responsibilities Effectively involved in different phases of SDLC including Designing Programming Testing and Documentation Using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 as an IDE developed single page website for the company using aspNET framework My responsibility was to create the web pages for home and products module Every morning my duty was to discuss the functional and nonfunctional requirements with the manager before going ahead with the code implementations The database contained 6 tables and my responsibility was to design the database using SQL SERVER Used C for backend functionalities HTML CSS for designing web pages and SQL for storing and retrieving data Used C advanced concepts like Automatic properties Anonymous types Lambda Expressions Extension Methods Used Web Services to fetch data required and work accordingly also used the concepts of Serialization Used LINQ to build set of operations parameters and expressions Binary Unary Lambda during execution aimed at Querying a set of data from SQL Server Used SOAP to implement Web Services and consumed and published XML web services in the application Implemented business logicrules using WCF services and integrated with the UI components Developed Entity framework based database access layer using ADONET and Entity Framework Developed module which deals with validating user changing passwords and searching of information depending upon priority of user in site using ASPNET Used the ASPNET State Management techniques like Session State View State to retain the values between the pages transactions where Session is managed in out Proc mode Wrote JavaScript code for validating the simple control instead of sending them to the server side which was degrading the performance of the web pages Extensive use of Web Services SOAP XML XSL to expose the reports to facilitate information sharing Generated various reports using Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services SSRS developed reports by pulling data from various sources and presenting in SQL Server Reporting Services SSRS and used Datasets for the SSRS reports Worked with Product management on product feature requirements definition and refinement Used TFS for Agile Planning and collaboration Performed Unit testing Integration testing and
