March 2015 to Present Responsibilities At RanLife I have been working under the direction of our senior developer to help shoulder the development load that is coming from a fastgrowing company So far I have been working in PHP and CodeIgnitor to implement new features into RanLifes custom CRM Much of what I have done involves setting up REST calls Additionally I have also worked extensively with

Additional responsibilities that I have include assisting with sysadmin responsibilities on our Linux and Ubuntu servers occasionally writing cronjob scripts to handle automated emails form mapping and collaborating with our frontend developer on form design Accomplishments The largest impact that I have had so far in my position is getting a working version of our chat application ready for deployment It is nearly finished and will be implemented to over half of the companys employees by the end of the month Additionally I have been able to influence the direction that our dev team is going by helping push more modern development techniques and best practices As a result of my time with RanLife our dev team will have actually begun using some type of VCS most likely Git our
