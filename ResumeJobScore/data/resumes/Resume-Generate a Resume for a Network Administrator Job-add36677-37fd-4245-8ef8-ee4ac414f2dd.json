    "clean_data": "Pricing Analyst Pricing Analyst Pricing Analyst PetroChoice Norristown PA Work Experience Pricing Analyst PetroChoice 2019 to Present As a pricing analyst I am responsible for ensuring accuracy of vendor and customer pricing via timely execution and assessment of pricing changes this requires coordinating with PetroChoice Sales and Procurement team members as well as with key vendor representatives I also work closely with various members of the Leadership Team to support ad hoc strategic initiatives via quantitativelyoriented data analysis generally related to margin assessment Specific tasks include but are not limited to the following Update vendor prices in the Companys ERP systems as per announced vendor schedules and conduct impact analysis against contract pricing rebates coordinating with the Rebates team as required etc Develop contract pricing recommendations based on broadscale vendor pricing changes targeting opportunities to increase margins work with Sales leaders to evaluate and implement final customer prices including development of customerspecific collateral Conduct periodic assessments of system costs and prices in item records and pricing libraries to evaluate accuracy and identify opportunities to increase margin working with both Sales and Procurement team leaders Review and assess data feeds provided by external partners as they pertain to pricing Develop and evaluate data queries reports to support standing and adhoc strategic requests Data Analyst Cyber Security 2018 to 2018 TEKsystems I stepped into this role as the first data analyst on a team of cyber security analysts Within two months of starting this position one team had the capability to no longer rely on locally stored spreadsheets Working with this team and a PowerBI user I analyzed what information was available and what was necessary Using python scripts I created SQL database tables which could then be used by the PowerBI user to create the reports automatically rather than as they had been manually using Excel These tables then also allowed for trending analysis which is of great value in cyber security in terms of remediation triage and performance metrics I was hired as a data analyst but was informed upon starting the position that I would also need to act as the DBA I began meeting with the three team members who used the existing SQL database the most and we began brainstorming as to what the new normalized database would look like We are planning to use numerous views for PowerBI users I also added numerous indexes to existing tables to enhance performance in the interim The new database is architected and ready for structuring what remains is determining how to transition the existing data with minimum impact I have been asked to enhance reporting metrics and assist in updating existing Dashboards In order to accomplish this I have created numerous tables which will become views in the new database I analyzed calculated and created a table which averages the median and closest values on either side over a given week 7 days of values of scan totals This number is then stored as the weeks reporting figure for trending reporting I created a table of scanning detail for efficiency purposes Many millions of scanning detail records are created each day when really only a few hundred thousand need to be created for the current reporting needs This new abbreviated table has been created for daily scan records Then this table is used to generate our 30day scan summary records and any other investigative reporting we want to do This has increased efficiency substantially I created a report which determines for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses how successfully it was scanned over the last 30 days What percentage of the time did we scan it successfully Out of those successful scans did it have open ports or no open ports or did it flap There are similar reports for Class C subnets Using pattern matching I supplied a list of approximately 57 million IPv6 addresses for the scanning operations team to search for on our perimeter Using Rs machine learning capabilities the next step would be to automate this process Data AnalystData Steward Presidio Corporation 2016 to 2018 Responsible for maintenance of item inventory catalog and manufacturer data Analyzed approximately 10000 manually

    "resume_data": "Pricing Analyst Pricing Analyst Pricing Analyst PetroChoice Norristown PA Work Experience Pricing Analyst PetroChoice 2019 to Present As a pricing analyst I am responsible for ensuring accuracy of vendor and customer pricing via timely execution and assessment of pricing changes this requires coordinating with PetroChoice Sales and Procurement team members as well as with key vendor representatives I also work closely with various members of the Leadership Team to support ad hoc strategic initiatives via quantitativelyoriented data analysis generally related to margin assessment Specific tasks include but are not limited to the following Update vendor prices in the Companys ERP systems as per announced vendor schedules and conduct impact analysis against contract pricing rebates coordinating with the Rebates team as required etc Develop contract pricing recommendations based on broadscale vendor pricing changes targeting opportunities to increase margins work with Sales leaders to evaluate and implement final customer prices including development of customerspecific collateral Conduct periodic assessments of system costs and prices in item records and pricing libraries to evaluate accuracy and identify opportunities to increase margin working with both Sales and Procurement team leaders Review and assess data feeds provided by external partners as they pertain to pricing Develop and evaluate data queries reports to support standing and adhoc strategic requests Data Analyst Cyber Security 2018 to 2018 TEKsystems I stepped into this role as the first data analyst on a team of cyber security analysts Within two months of starting this position one team had the capability to no longer rely on locally stored spreadsheets Working with this team and a PowerBI user I analyzed what information was available and what was necessary Using python scripts I created SQL database tables which could then be used by the PowerBI user to create the reports automatically rather than as they had been manually using Excel These tables then also allowed for trending analysis which is of great value in cyber security in terms of remediation triage and performance metrics I was hired as a data analyst but was informed upon starting the position that I would also need to act as the DBA I began meeting with the three team members who used the existing SQL database the most and we began brainstorming as to what the new normalized database would look like We are planning to use numerous views for PowerBI users I also added numerous indexes to existing tables to enhance performance in the interim The new database is architected and ready for structuring what remains is determining how to transition the existing data with minimum impact I have been asked to enhance reporting metrics and assist in updating existing Dashboards In order to accomplish this I have created numerous tables which will become views in the new database I analyzed calculated and created a table which averages the median and closest values on either side over a given week 7 days of values of scan totals This number is then stored as the weeks reporting figure for trending reporting I created a table of scanning detail for efficiency purposes Many millions of scanning detail records are created each day when really only a few hundred thousand need to be created for the current reporting needs This new abbreviated table has been created for daily scan records Then this table is used to generate our 30day scan summary records and any other investigative reporting we want to do This has increased efficiency substantially I created a report which determines for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses how successfully it was scanned over the last 30 days What percentage of the time did we scan it successfully Out of those successful scans did it have open ports or no open ports or did it flap There are similar reports for Class C subnets Using pattern matching I supplied a list of approximately 57 million IPv6 addresses for the scanning operations team to search for on our perimeter Using Rs machine learning capabilities the next step would be to automate this process Data AnalystData Steward Presidio Corporation 2016 to 2018 Responsible for maintenance of item inventory catalog and manufacturer data Analyzed approximately 10000 manually
