ZEUS is a central database which accommodate and provide a single glance of Investment Banking credit risk data to credit officers risk control and reporting and data integrity users It is a Java and Oracle based application that collates processes and denormalizes credit risk information between 10 upstream and downstream through more than 4000 interdependent jobs and more than 50 calculators for each business day and monthends The processed data is reflected on a frontend call IRIS which is connected through a tomcat based middle tier webservice layer called HADES ZEUS also have a reporting layer serving MIS system Developed and implemented jobs like data loaders data processors calculators and exporters using Java J2EE and JMS etc which are used to load creditrisk data from upstream process and calculate the exposures and then export it to the respective downstream Used development IDEs like Eclipse for Java and Toad for PLSQL development Wrote scripts for the jobs to execute them on the Unix server using Shell scripting Monitored and debugged Java logs on Unix server Used basic Unix commands to perform various operations on the Unix server Used basic Linux commands for

ZEUS is a central database which accommodate and provide a single glance of Investment Banking credit risk data to credit officers risk control and reporting and data integrity users It is a Java and Oracle based application that collates processes and denormalizes credit risk information between 10 upstream and downstream through more than 4000 interdependent jobs and more than 50 calculators for each business day and monthends The processed data is reflected on a frontend call IRIS which is connected through a tomcat based middle tier webservice layer called HADES ZEUS also have a reporting layer serving MIS system Developed and implemented jobs like data loaders data processors calculators and exporters using Java J2EE and JMS etc which are used to load creditrisk data from upstream process and calculate the exposures and then export it to the respective downstream Used development IDEs like Eclipse for Java and Toad for PLSQL development Wrote scripts for the jobs to execute them on the Unix server using Shell scripting Monitored and debugged Java logs on Unix server Used basic Unix commands to perform various operations on the Unix server Used basic Linux commands for
