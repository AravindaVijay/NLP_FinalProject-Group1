with Microsoft Software Developer Azure Marketplace Deployments January 2018 to June 2018 Developed a custom tool that enabled UI tests in Dynamics AX to dynamically load environment data enabling staging and production environments to run the same test steps and reducing the number of required test recordings by 50 Our proofofconcept test took an incoming Purchase Order generated a Sales Order and then completed a billing against that order Results were reported through the VSTS test run framework This tool was written using C and Windows forms and distributed as a standalone windows app and distributed as msi installable program in a closed beta During the beta period I supported this product as the sole technical contact for customer troubleshooting and configuration Software Developer Microsoft Lifecycle Services 2015 to 2017 I developed features for webbased enterprise planning software It helped users navigate a multithousand node tree of business actions that described the endtoend process for some business activity like developing a new product My major contributions to this project included a system to asynchronously update a TFS server with any changes that users made to their customized tree track FitGap requirements and notify the customer if any errors occurred while synchronizing the data I completed this task using C server code JavaScript and AJAX to asynchronously notify the web server when an update was required knowledge of tree structures the TFS API and HTMLCSS and ReactJS for the UI elements Another feature that I implemented allowed our customers to add extensible data to these nodes based on their unique business requirements I implemented six new data types that customers could use with a viewmode and editmode UI for each one and a further option to differentiate by region and language I achieved this using JSON format to store the data AJAX to push changes to the server HTMLCSS to design the UIs C and Entity Framework to save

for Microsoft Dynamics Retail As a developer I created responsive layouts for Stock Count Inventory Lookup and other scenarios using a HTML CSS and a responsive grid system similar to Bootstrap I also programmed clientside validation to ensure that all parts of a transaction were complete before sending it to the server and implemented a minor feature allowing stores to create or repair product bundles during Inventory I completed this project using JavaScript Typescript and KnockOut I wrote and executed manual test plans and automated tests Afterwards I investigated any failures to determine if they were caused by test bugs project bugs or configuration or execution failures and logged the resulting bugs Automated tests covered straightforward scenarios while manual testing

testing maintaining test coverage of new features and developing new deployment tools and pipelines Primarily using NodeJs Mocha and Azure Pipelines formerly VSTS or TFS Software Developer Sonata Software 2014 to Present Contracted to Microsoft teams to development to create extensions for Microsoft Dynamics 365 or related web projects Use knowledge of web UX principles to create cloudbased applications running on Azure C and MVC including web UI clientside code serverside code and SQL database Twice recognized with the Sonata DNA award for commitment to maintaining the clients schedule Experience in testing and development with D365 Retail POS Building extensions and testing in Finance module and Task Recorder Development on Lifecycle Services and Business Process Modeler Projects with Microsoft Software Developer Azure Marketplace Deployments January 2018 to June 2018 Developed a custom tool that enabled UI tests in Dynamics AX to dynamically load environment data enabling staging and production environments to run the same test steps and reducing the number of required test recordings by 50 Our proofofconcept test took an incoming Purchase Order generated a Sales Order and then completed a billing against that order Results were reported through the VSTS test run framework This tool was written using C and Windows forms and distributed as a standalone windows app and distributed as msi installable program in a closed beta During the beta period I supported this product as the sole technical contact for customer troubleshooting and configuration Software Developer Microsoft Lifecycle Services 2015 to 2017 I developed features for webbased enterprise planning software It helped users navigate a multithousand node tree of business actions that described the endtoend process for some business activity like developing a new product My major contributions to this project included a system to asynchronously update a TFS server with any changes that users made to their customized tree track FitGap requirements and notify the customer if any errors occurred while synchronizing the data I completed this task using C server code JavaScript and AJAX to asynchronously notify the web server when an update was required knowledge of tree structures the TFS API and HTMLCSS and ReactJS for the UI elements Another feature that I implemented allowed our customers to add extensible data to these nodes based on their unique business requirements I implemented six new data types that customers could use with a viewmode and editmode UI for each one and a further option to differentiate by region and language I achieved this using JSON format to store the data AJAX to push changes to the server HTMLCSS to design the UIs C and Entity Framework to save to the SQL database Software Developer Microsoft Lifecycle Services August 2015 to December 2015 AugustDecember 2015 I did development and testing for the Windows Tablet app for PointofSale software for Microsoft Dynamics Retail As a developer I created responsive layouts for Stock Count Inventory Lookup and other scenarios using a HTML CSS and a responsive grid system similar to Bootstrap I also programmed clientside validation to ensure that all parts of a transaction were complete before sending it to the server and implemented a minor feature allowing stores to create or repair product bundles during Inventory I completed this project using JavaScript Typescript and KnockOut I wrote and executed manual test plans and automated tests Afterwards I investigated any failures to determine if they were caused by test bugs project bugs or configuration or execution failures and logged the resulting bugs Automated tests covered straightforward scenarios while manual testing focused on complex scenarios with multiple interruptions roles and points of customer contact Manual testing also included using cash drawers barcode scanners receipt printers and other peripherals
