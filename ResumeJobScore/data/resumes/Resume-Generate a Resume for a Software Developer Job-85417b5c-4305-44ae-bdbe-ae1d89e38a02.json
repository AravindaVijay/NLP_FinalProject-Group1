Environment NumPy SciPy Scikit PANDAS matplotlib SQL HTML GRADUATE PROJECTS Simulate the components of a BPSK modem receiver Designing each components of a modem where the modulator delivers samples through the channel spin the channel output down sample and deliver the channel distorted time offset and spinning sequence to the frequency locked loop This output is down sampled and fed to the timing recovery loop which in turn is presented to the equalizer and phaselocked loop Design communication channel in Matlab An input QPSK random data sequence is sent through a shaping followed by a matched filter The channel induced distortion introduces ISI and the equalizer which is a FIR filter serves to minimize its effect Decision directed LMS algorithm is used to equalize the channel Thus a communication channel is formed by a cascading the above process Echo canceller Designed an echo canceller to cancel the echoes caused due to acoustic coupling of speech signal into microphone of a speaker phone Additionally equalizers and and cancellers are built to remove the effect of communication path and crosstalk path Sign Language Translator Improve communications for individuals with hearing and speech disabilities Use of glove sensors and Arduino complier The data streams are synchronized utilizing a highspeed microcontroller in order to facilitate fast processing that the text and audible streams can be generated simultaneously in real time Noise filtering in Audio file Various types of DSP filters are designed to clean up a given corrupted audio file using Matlab code

Environment NumPy SciPy Scikit PANDAS matplotlib SQL HTML GRADUATE PROJECTS Simulate the components of a BPSK modem receiver Designing each components of a modem where the modulator delivers samples through the channel spin the channel output down sample and deliver the channel distorted time offset and spinning sequence to the frequency locked loop This output is down sampled and fed to the timing recovery loop which in turn is presented to the equalizer and phaselocked loop Design communication channel in Matlab An input QPSK random data sequence is sent through a shaping followed by a matched filter The channel induced distortion introduces ISI and the equalizer which is a FIR filter serves to minimize its effect Decision directed LMS algorithm is used to equalize the channel Thus a communication channel is formed by a cascading the above process Echo canceller Designed an echo canceller to cancel the echoes caused due to acoustic coupling of speech signal into microphone of a speaker phone Additionally equalizers and and cancellers are built to remove the effect of communication path and crosstalk path Sign Language Translator Improve communications for individuals with hearing and speech disabilities Use of glove sensors and Arduino complier The data streams are synchronized utilizing a highspeed microcontroller in order to facilitate fast processing that the text and audible streams can be generated simultaneously in real time Noise filtering in Audio file Various types of DSP filters are designed to clean up a given corrupted audio file using Matlab code Simulation of OFDM Implementation of OFDM and a shaped SCOFDM modem whose modulator is implemented by 128point output IFFT Here short and long preamble are used for start of OFDM and channel
