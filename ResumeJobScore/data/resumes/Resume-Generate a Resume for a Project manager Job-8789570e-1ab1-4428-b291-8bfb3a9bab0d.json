Appliances httpswwwijsrnetarchivev3i10T0NUMTQxNjcpdf 201410 In modern health care society we are presenting an innovative idea in the world of healthcare services in the form of ubiquitous MHealth android application The key feature of this application is to provide vital information under one roof This software covers the divergence between all the interconnected services in a health care center ie the interconnection between doctor patient pharmacist insurance assistant etc and annals authority security for annals The main aim of this application is to provide a userfriendly interface in stress driven situation This application provides remote access to medical records doctors prescription patients database and patients insurance policy Mainly this application focuses a health environment for the stimulus information sharing using portable android devices In order to provide security and authentication various prospective strategies like professional authentications user authentication in between doctor pharmacistpatient patientinsurance agents are used The main objective of this application is to diminish the gap between doctor and patient Android HealthDr Application for Synchronous Information Sharing httpsieeexploreieeeorgdocument6821398 201404 Android HealthDR is innovative idea for ambulatory appliances In rapid developing technology we are providing HealthDR application for the insurance agent dispensary patients physician annals management security for annals So principally the ample of record are maintain in to the hospitals The application just needs to be installed in the customer site with IT environment Main purpose of our application is to provide the healthy environment to the patient Our cream focus is on the HealthDR application meet to the patient regiment For the personal use of member we provide authentication service strategy for HealthDR application Prospective strategy includes Professional Authentications User Authentication by doctor to the patient actuary and dispensary Remote access is available to the medical annals doctor affability and patient affability HealthDR provides expertness anytime and anywhere The application is middleware to isolate the information from affability management client discovery and transit of database Annotations of records are kept in the bibliography Mainly this
