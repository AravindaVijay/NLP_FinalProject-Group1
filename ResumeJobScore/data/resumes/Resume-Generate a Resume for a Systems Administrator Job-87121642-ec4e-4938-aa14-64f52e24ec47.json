allergy immunotherapy the company is Denmark based with a strong presence in the US market The Company manufactures allergy diagnostic and treatment medications Clientbase consists of Allergy Specialists treating and testing patients in the US and in Europe Companys management decided to develop a new webbased system from scratch to replace their manual work which allows enhanced and automated functionality to keep track of supplies inventory testing and compliance The Project was developed using Python technologies as a back end and frontend was developed using Angular and deployment was done over to AWS EC2 The system consisted of an endtoend manufacturing management application which works independently if needed The first module contained an inventory system which allows the system to perform several tasks such as Inventory realtime tracking Reconciliation Yearly Count Track returns etc The second module was used by the Compounding department to record every aspect of the manufacturing process as per the regulations The final module was used for testing storing test results into database creating new tests validating tests and running diagnostics I was responsible for the development of Inventory module primarily along with other modules as when needed Responsibilities Involved in analysis and design of supplymanagement application and participated in requirements gathering and worked with architect in designing and modeling the application Built backend of inventory management application with Django Web framework creating a connection to a MySQL database and querying inventory data to store and handle medicine raw materials reagents and supplies Created Deleted Updated Models Views and Templates as needed using Python and Django to connect the SQL database to templates Migrated from SQLite database to PostgreSQL and created query programs including SELECT UPDATE ORDER BY INSERT and GROUP BY PostgreSQL had the proper security settings for a production environment Made extensive use of Python modules like Collections Requests BeautifulSoup Matplotlib Re OS to extend Pythons default functionality make HTTP request scrape data and visualize it Created dynamic validated forms using Django builtin forms and Javascript to receive user input and ensure proper data format was sent to the database Consumed thirdparty APIs using python HTTP Requests to import supply information from suppliers Made use of AWS S3 buckets and Bitnami virtual machine to both store and extract documentsdata and test the application Responded to clients needs and suggestedimplemented agreed changes Used Python and participated in entire SDLC to build application that replaces SAP functionality Customized Django builtin forms using ModelForms Forms Form validation to improve the functionality of the application Created custom exceptions from Pythons BaseException class in Python to create specific errors for users to handle Collaborated with testing team and responded to concerns and bugs using JIRA Modeled and scraped data as needed using Beautifulsoup during investigations of new features or issues Environments Python

emergency and routine blood transfusion items Red Blood Cells Platelets and Plasma to all the patients in the southern states of Florida and Georgia The company is one of the only legal provider of blood in the state of Florida Blood is donated to Oneblood and Oneblood handles the testing and preparation of blood samples to send to area hospitals for transfusions I worked as part of the development team improving their system of samples and patient records Their system was outdated and needed to be updated to comply with new federal regulations Major technologies used were Python Django Web Framework and Angular for the frontend The system contained separate modules for Tests Patients Samples and protocols Responsibilities Participated in the SDLC by working with team on designing building and testing Donor Portal application to increase donor participation and accuracy of tests Wrote multiple Django QuerysetsSQL Queries using the ORM system and MySQL Workbench to create user button commands to extract donor and testing data from the management system Utilized MVT paradigm to build a responsive and secure application using Django Web Framework Using Models to create database tables Views to process and display donor blood sample and testing data and Templates to display on the application Worked with large MySQL tables and data using queries like SELECT UPDATE ORDER BY INSERT and GROUP BY to create views and organize information displayed on the application Maintained program library and technical documentation adding new features and removing as needed Performed troubleshooting fixed and modified code to remove bugs using unit tests and PyUnit Worked with development team using Agile Methodology Performed data analysis using Pandas and
