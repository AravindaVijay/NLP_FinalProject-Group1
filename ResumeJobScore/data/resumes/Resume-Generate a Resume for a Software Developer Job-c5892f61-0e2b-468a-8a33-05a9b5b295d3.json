collecting requirements providing guidelines for design creating application architecture implementation that includes various stages in development QA code signing and releasing to Market Experience developing web applications with SPA Single Page Application frameworks like AngularJS Strong experience in working on a modern full stack JavaScript environment like MEAN stack Extensively used UIRouter for binding data to different states and rendering different templates Extensive experience in developing applications in a single page SPAs using various JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS Reactjs Nodejs and Bootstrap Experienced in developing micro services using NodeJS ExpressJs Docker and AWS Used AngularJS concepts like Modules Controllers Directives Filters FactoriesServices etc Experience in using IDEs like WebStorm Intellij Idea VScode PyCharm Experienced in Agile Development process for diverse requirements Used tools like JIRA Confluence Experienced building components with ReactJS Experienced with web services RESTful and SOAP Experienced with Git and other source control management Experienced with SQLNOSQL databases Extensively worked on memory leaks push notifications content providers multiple screen support data offline usage accounts and sync on Android Expertise in Object Oriented Architecture Design and Programming from design to implementation Experience in architecture design development and implementation of software applications and testing Experienced in web service protocols such as JSON HTTP and XML Ability to coordinate with various team members involved in the project Work Experience Staff Engineer Western Digital San Jose CA May 2016 to Present Integral part in the design and development of the system management application for the storage racks that helps the end user to monitor dashboards and its data trends I developed GUI for Customer Bring Up Wizard CBW which enhanced user experience and was well appreciated by customers Controlled GUI elements based on roles and their permissions by following Rolebased access control RBAC mechanism Worked on fullstack development with a focus on AngularJs on the front end and NodeJS on the back end Worked on Nodejs Middleware framework like Expressjs essentially developed microservices and serve them through middleware Implemented tokenbased authentication with JWT Created ExpressJs Server to build MVC framework from front end AngularJS to back end MongoDB in order to provide broadcast service Used NodeJS for serverside and ExpressJs as the framework Written callback functions for the RESTful API and for creating Services Involved in consuming RESTful Services using NodeJS and ExpressJs Framework and responsible for managing the interchange of data between the server and the users Worked extensively with cloud services such as Amazon Web Services AWS Used JavaScript AWSSDK to configure AWS S3 develop APIs for bucket properties such as OLM Versioning Replication also for bucket operations like create and delete of buckets and also managing policies for S3 buckets Involved in developing Single Page web applications in microservice architecture using MEAN Mongo Express Angular Node stack and NPM modules Developed application using AngularJs and NodeJS connecting to Mongo database on the backend Also worked with the web application development team to ensure proper integration between backend and web application Took part in automation by designing developing of test cases for a particular feature using Java and Selenium WebDriver Also took part in developing automation using BDD development process Created automation scripts in python that validates the security of the APIs by checking authentication and authorization and also if the API response contains any secure data Developed several REST APIs handling JSON requests Used realtime search and analytics engine Elasticsearch as a metrics data store and use its aggregations to answer queries such as reporting and plotting graphs in dashboard for horizontal scalability and high performance Fixed issues faced during installation of single geo and multi geo systems at the customer site Deployed and worked with virtual machines for local development and testing without the need to use physical racks Worked with Continuous IntegrationDeployment tools such as Jenkins to run integration jobs Worked with version control tools such as GIT Extensively worked in fast paced Agile development process and used tools such as JIRA and confluence

Actively involved in all stages of Software development life cycle including Analysis Implementation testing and support Used AngularJS as framework to create a Single Page Application SPA which can bind data to specific views and synchronize data with server Extensively worked with noderestclient module which Allows connecting to any API REST and get results as Object Implemented the service using NodeJS for performance development maintenance and deployment reasons Implemented different validation control on the webpages using AngularJS Extensively involved in design discussions and user experience sessions to provide inputs on the layout and UX Implement data gridtables using Bootstrap and AngularJS for front end client facing the Single Page Application SPA Extensively used CSS and Bootstrap for styling the HTML elements Handled clientside validation using JavaScript Involved in several bug fixes for existing application and also made several enhancement requests Responsible for consuming the REST services and parsing JSON response and serve to the front end Coordinated with teams to ensure quality of service Provided subsequent releases which included feature changes
