most people I know I apply logic reason and emotional aspects in equal proportion to the solution of problems I have an unusual amount of intuition when it comes to people I am able to figure out motivations and intentions with a high rate of accuracy Even with people whom Ive had very little interaction with I dont fit stereotypes very well Im often the odd one out in a group I surprise people often with my reactions and perspectives I have a high EQ which I feel is incredibly useful particularly in my fields of IT Management and Project Management IT infrastructure so I make a point of flexing and improving these skills I love to read and have the ability to absorb and apply abstract principles and transfer these points of learning to other fields and applications which Im told is a relatively rare ability I love being different and surprising and not fitting stereotypes Im rather pleased to be me I have a great selfesteem and good confidence which makes me willing to seek out and accept challenges which I may not appear to be able to deliver on initially Im not afraid of failure In fact I think it is an essential part of the experimental process that gets you to success This is why Im unique Sincerely Henry Thomas",
