web middleware and back end systems in Python SQL and Perl for Linux and Windows Created PyUnit test scripts and used for unit testing Used SVN for the version control Developed Merge jobs in Python to extract and load data into MySQL database Developed user interfaces using HTML5 and JavaScript Utilized Agile process and JIRA issue management to track sprint cycles Debugging the failure issues by capturing the array and register dumps using Python scripts traces and performing several experiments by interacting with the design team Development of several Python APIs and harassers that works both in Linux and windows and maintaining them using the revision control SVN Used python scripts to update content in the database and manipulate files Resolved issues and improvised the process to
