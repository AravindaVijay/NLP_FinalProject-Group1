management suite named Caliber from JavaScript with jQuery into an Angular 4 application Trainers can input grades and feedback for each of their trainees The quality department can input their evaluations on the batch of trainees Trainers and quality personnel can comment on a trainees profile The Caliber suite also provides a variety of reports on different levels of granularity using visual dashboards and tabular data Users can generate individual and batch PDF reports to distribute to clients trainees and other stakeholders The following link has more information on the project
