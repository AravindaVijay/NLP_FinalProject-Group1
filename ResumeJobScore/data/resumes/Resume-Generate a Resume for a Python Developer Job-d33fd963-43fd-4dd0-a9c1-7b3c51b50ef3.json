centralize application error information for errors occurring in current and future distributed shop floor applications Collaborated with other developers to architect and develop a NET based endto end manufacturing information system The system was successfully deployed to a sheeted paper manufacturer at one plant and a corrugated paper manufacturer at three other plants The systems many capabilities included production order entry plant scheduling distribution of realtime information to machines inside the factory tagging of finished product in realtime directing shipment of finished product and tracking raw material in the customers warehouse Technologies Net Framework 20 35 C MSMQ XML JavaScript and SQL Server Net Developer GIMIT Delhi Delhi May 2009 to May 2009 Project 1 Developing code and testing This project consists of two modules One is a typical SMTP Server module to handle mail transactions The other is the Intelligent Spam Filter module The Intelligent Spam Filter contains an array of spam filters and monitors their performance and allots ranks accordingly Environment Windows 2000 Technologies Used C Project 2 Development Integration Real time flight information distribution engine to gather flight status information from Airport sources and prepare web services and xml documents feeds for various sources The application is designed to run on Servers Hence the application is built to have less memory footprint and consistency on robust performance The team of developers which I was one of them developed the application as Windows Service
