maintenance effort reduced by 80 Redesigned and built companys Oracle Weblogic application server infrastructure such that speed of application deployment was increased fourfold and environment was simplified yielding easier maintenance by technical support staff staffing levels required to support the environment was reduced Designed and managed migration from and consolidation of companys inefficient Sun server on Solaris environment to a highperformance virtualized IBM pSeries PowerVM environment running AIX and Linux within tight business deadlines server environment support efficiency was substantially increased and server resource utilization efficiency was increased from 18 to over 75 Designed and built 3 node HACMP cluster for Oracle database and Gentran applications

ADECCO INC New York NY July 2005 to November 2013 Automated security configuration and server maintenance by creating selfhealing environment using CFEngine eliminated need to depend upon humans remembering to close ports shut down services ensure inappropriate services not running on hosts etc environment automatically kept in defined secure state based on host function quarterly security audit remediation tasks dropped by 60 Automated building of VMs using NIM as a result team were able to issue a single command build of new VMs in 20 minutes a 98 reduction of build times Created and maintained secure server images to ensure all new VMs conformed to firm security policies out of the gate Wrote Perl scripts to automate management of Gentran application environment environment maintenance effort reduced by 80 Redesigned and built companys Oracle Weblogic application server infrastructure such that speed of application deployment was increased fourfold and environment was simplified yielding easier maintenance by technical support staff staffing levels required to support the environment was reduced Designed and managed migration from and consolidation of companys inefficient Sun server on Solaris environment to a highperformance virtualized IBM pSeries PowerVM environment running AIX and Linux within tight business deadlines server environment support efficiency was substantially increased and server resource utilization efficiency was increased from 18 to over 75 Designed and built 3 node HACMP cluster for Oracle database and Gentran applications to achieve application redundancy Designed and built internal Enterprise Systems department web site allowing for greater management visibility collaboration and a centralized searchable documentation database which reduced new staff training time by 20 Secured environment by replacing telnet and ftp protocols with SSH thereby reducing risks associated with compromise of environment and penalties
