duties specializing ERAM automaton Highlights Certified En Route Air Traffic control experience Effective listening Adaptable Fast learner Strong collaborative team Member Application of risk management Principles Learning style assessment Accomplishments Preformed a comprehensive Analysis of the Federal Aviation Administrations En Route Automation Modernization ERAM upgrade I was a member of the Independent Operational Assessment IOA team that performed a comprehensive Analysis of the ERAM upgrade to the National Air Space System NAS I performed in depth triage of ERAM anomalies at 16 different ARTCC as an ERAM Subject Matter Expert SME And at times made recommendations for what kind of adaptations to local Automation could be made to enhance ERAMs performance at a particular facility Experience Air Traffic Controller 08 1983 to 12 2015 Company Name City State While working more than 32 years as an En Route Air Traffic Controller ATCS in the En Route environment I maintained the safe orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic in the NAS I was an expert at various disciplines of air traffic control while maintaining at least the minimum separation standard s and adhering to procedures and regulation as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration 04 2013 to 01 2015 Was a National En Route Automation Modernization ERAM Subject Mater Expert SME and visited 16 En Route Air Traffic Control Centers ARTCC and identified ERAM anomalies In addition to documenting ERAM s undesirable process also recommending adaptation changes that resulted in the desired behavior for the affected facility When not documenting ERAM anomalies or consulting on ERAM work a rounds I conducted training of the controllers at the sectors working traffic concerning ERAM functionality During my collateral duties as an IOA team member and a National ERAM SME I was able to maintain my currency every month and conducted OJT 09 2008 to 04 2013 Served as a National SME on the FAA s Independent Operational Assessment IOA team As a team member I collected data and collaborated on the final report concerning the operational readiness for ERAM s National Deployment 28 years of experience working transition sectors from domestic Air Traffic Services to Oceanic Air Traffic services This airspace required manual coordination on route altitude and time estimates with Oakland Oceanic sectors as well as establishing oceanic separation standers for the affected flight before entering an oceanic sector This Radar Non Radar environment required me to correlate flight plans with incoming and outgoing tracks and either terminate or re identify the flight in a Radar environment Worked Arrival and Departure traffic In and out of Seattle Tacoma International Airport SEA for 32 years This required closely working with a level 5 Approach control facilitating the separation of aircraft during the transition phase of a flight from the terminal to the En Route environment This requires a strong working knowledge of geography for expediting flight on their flight plans while working within flow control restriction weather and volume limitations And before the wide acceptance of GPS navigation this required long range vectoring which required consideration of weather and traffic situations Sequenced traffic for Seattle Approach S46 from high sectors above FL230 and low sectors below FL240 as well as converging routes in sectors that were over the Cascade Mountains which introduced weather and train factors With 28 years of experience working aircraft in a transitional phase of flight back and forth from terminal and En Route I have extensive knowledge and experience with different types of route structures including the new Advanced R NAV SID s and STAR s with their descend and climb via phases of transitioning to and from the En Route to Terminal environment As well as more conventional types of En Route navigation like Jet routs victor airway Q routs K fixes as well as point to point GPS RNAV Latitude longitude Navigation and conventional SID s and STAR s I worked daily military training flights on IR and VR routes airspace reservation both moving ALTRAV and special Use airspace SUA I have experience with Naval P3 F18 E2 A6 and EA6 aircraft Air force F16 F15 F4 C17 C141 KC35 B2 and B52 Army A10 UH60 and AH64 and Air National Guard F4 F15 and F16 and their missions The sectors I was certified on had Naval Air force and Army bases and a joint civilian Air National Guard base My experience involves clearing fighters into and recovering fighters from special use airspace as well as air refueling missions and helicopters for the Army back and forth from base to training grounds Controlled cross border flights between the USA and Canada for over 32 years Experience includes passing manual time estimates flight plans and making and taking manual hand offs via voice calls Also experience at some of the limitations of CATTS the Canadian version of ERAM and ERAM s interfaces are Have 32 years experience providing approach control services at uncontrolled and tower controlled airports One of the tower controlled airports was Paine Field in Everett WA Pain field PAE is a key airport in the Boeing Company manufacturing process and worked closely with Boeing in their testing and certification process for new airplanes Also Pain field is an airport that many new pilots would go and do multiple practice approaches for training This environment meant the traffic pattern at Paine field had a large variety of aircraft Large commercial aircraft navy fighters and small single engine trainers this required the separation and sequence the traffic but apply wake turbulence procedures in many instances While providing approach control services at PAE we meet the requirements to use 3NM separation in most of the area This required vigilantes as to how fare the aircraft was from the RADAR antenna and adding to the complexity of this particular airspace was the West side was over water or low lying land but the train rose very quickly to the East required different techniques for lost com or vectoring to the final approach course Preformed duties as a SME in Plans and Programs ZSE 510 consulting on the feasibly of releasing equipment to Airways and Facilities for maintained Preformed SME duties in Airspace ZSE 520 working on letters of agreements with adjacent facilities as well as airspace changes During My involvement as an Airspace SME I was part of a team that was involved in some major sector realignments that facilitated arrivals and departures from the South and East at SEA as well as traffic transiting between Seattle SEA and Portland OR PDX During this realignment we also collaborated on procedures and sector alignment for Vancouver Canada YVR Arrivals and Departures from the South Also I was also involved in the initial stages of National High Altitude Redesign April 1991 I was certified as a Controller in Charge CIC As CIC I was responsible for the same tasks that a First Line supervisor would for dally operations Assigning work opening and closing sectors handling Emergences and approving leave and shift changes with in prescribed guild lines December 1987 I was certified as an On The Job Instructor OJTI November 1986 I Certified as a Certified Professional Controller CPC in Area C of Seattle ARTCC Then in September 1988 I voluntary transferred to Area A at Seattle ARTCC and became area rated May 1989 until retirement January

    "resume_data": "AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER Summary Retired Air Traffic Controller with more than 32 years of experience working traffic in the En Route Environment Performed OJTI CIC and ERAM SME duties specializing ERAM automaton Highlights Certified En Route Air Traffic control experience Effective listening Adaptable Fast learner Strong collaborative team Member Application of risk management Principles Learning style assessment Accomplishments Preformed a comprehensive Analysis of the Federal Aviation Administrations En Route Automation Modernization ERAM upgrade I was a member of the Independent Operational Assessment IOA team that performed a comprehensive Analysis of the ERAM upgrade to the National Air Space System NAS I performed in depth triage of ERAM anomalies at 16 different ARTCC as an ERAM Subject Matter Expert SME And at times made recommendations for what kind of adaptations to local Automation could be made to enhance ERAMs performance at a particular facility Experience Air Traffic Controller 08 1983 to 12 2015 Company Name City State While working more than 32 years as an En Route Air Traffic Controller ATCS in the En Route environment I maintained the safe orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic in the NAS I was an expert at various disciplines of air traffic control while maintaining at least the minimum separation standard s and adhering to procedures and regulation as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration 04 2013 to 01 2015 Was a National En Route Automation Modernization ERAM Subject Mater Expert SME and visited 16 En Route Air Traffic Control Centers ARTCC and identified ERAM anomalies In addition to documenting ERAM s undesirable process also recommending adaptation changes that resulted in the desired behavior for the affected facility When not documenting ERAM anomalies or consulting on ERAM work a rounds I conducted training of the controllers at the sectors working traffic concerning ERAM functionality During my collateral duties as an IOA team member and a National ERAM SME I was able to maintain my currency every month and conducted OJT 09 2008 to 04 2013 Served as a National SME on the FAA s Independent Operational Assessment IOA team As a team member I collected data and collaborated on the final report concerning the operational readiness for ERAM s National Deployment 28 years of experience working transition sectors from domestic Air Traffic Services to Oceanic Air Traffic services This airspace required manual coordination on route altitude and time estimates with Oakland Oceanic sectors as well as establishing oceanic separation standers for the affected flight before entering an oceanic sector This Radar Non Radar environment required me to correlate flight plans with incoming and outgoing tracks and either terminate or re identify the flight in a Radar environment Worked Arrival and Departure traffic In and out of Seattle Tacoma International Airport SEA for 32 years This required closely working with a level 5 Approach control facilitating the separation of aircraft during the transition phase of a flight from the terminal to the En Route environment This requires a strong working knowledge of geography for expediting flight on their flight plans while working within flow control restriction weather and volume limitations And before the wide acceptance of GPS navigation this required long range vectoring which required consideration of weather and traffic situations Sequenced traffic for Seattle Approach S46 from high sectors above FL230 and low sectors below FL240 as well as converging routes in sectors that were over the Cascade Mountains which introduced weather and train factors With 28 years of experience working aircraft in a transitional phase of flight back and forth from terminal and En Route I have extensive knowledge and experience with different types of route structures including the new Advanced R NAV SID s and STAR s with their descend and climb via phases of transitioning to and from the En Route to Terminal environment As well as more conventional types of En Route navigation like Jet routs victor airway Q routs K fixes as well as point to point GPS RNAV Latitude longitude Navigation and conventional SID s and STAR s I worked daily military training flights on IR and VR routes airspace reservation both moving ALTRAV and special Use airspace SUA I have experience with Naval P3 F18 E2 A6 and EA6 aircraft Air force F16 F15 F4 C17 C141 KC35 B2 and B52 Army A10 UH60 and AH64 and Air National Guard F4 F15 and F16 and their missions The sectors I was certified on had Naval Air force and Army bases and a joint civilian Air National Guard base My experience involves clearing fighters into and recovering fighters from special use airspace as well as air refueling missions and helicopters for the Army back and forth from base to training grounds Controlled cross border flights between the USA and Canada for over 32 years Experience includes passing manual time estimates flight plans and making and taking manual hand offs via voice calls Also experience at some of the limitations of CATTS the Canadian version of ERAM and ERAM s interfaces are Have 32 years experience providing approach control services at uncontrolled and tower controlled airports One of the tower controlled airports was Paine Field in Everett WA Pain field PAE is a key airport in the Boeing Company manufacturing process and worked closely with Boeing in their testing and certification process for new airplanes Also Pain field is an airport that many new pilots would go and do multiple practice approaches for training This environment meant the traffic pattern at Paine field had a large variety of aircraft Large commercial aircraft navy fighters and small single engine trainers this required the separation and sequence the traffic but apply wake turbulence procedures in many instances While providing approach control services at PAE we meet the requirements to use 3NM separation in most of the area This required vigilantes as to how fare the aircraft was from the RADAR antenna and adding to the complexity of this particular airspace was the West side was over water or low lying land but the train rose very quickly to the East required different techniques for lost com or vectoring to the final approach course Preformed duties as a SME in Plans and Programs ZSE 510 consulting on the feasibly of releasing equipment to Airways and Facilities for maintained Preformed SME duties in Airspace ZSE 520 working on letters of agreements with adjacent facilities as well as airspace changes During My involvement as an Airspace SME I was part of a team that was involved in some major sector realignments that facilitated arrivals and departures from the South and East at SEA as well as traffic transiting between Seattle SEA and Portland OR PDX During this realignment we also collaborated on procedures and sector alignment for Vancouver Canada YVR Arrivals and Departures from the South Also I was also involved in the initial stages of National High Altitude Redesign April 1991 I was certified as a Controller in Charge CIC As CIC I was responsible for the same tasks that a First Line supervisor would for dally operations Assigning work opening and closing sectors handling Emergences and approving leave and shift changes with in prescribed guild lines December 1987 I was certified as an On The Job Instructor OJTI November 1986 I Certified as a Certified Professional Controller CPC in Area C of Seattle ARTCC Then in September 1988 I voluntary transferred to Area A at Seattle ARTCC and became area rated May 1989 until retirement January
