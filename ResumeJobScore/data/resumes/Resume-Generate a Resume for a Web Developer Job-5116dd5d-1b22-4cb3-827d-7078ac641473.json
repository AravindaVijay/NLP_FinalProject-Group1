containing network infrastructure provisioning automation for world class datacenters Senior Software Engineer Leadpages April 2017 to July 2017 Greater MinneapolisSt Paul Area At Leadpages I helped maintain their web application backend which was written in Python built on Webapp2 and deployed to Google AppEngine I fixed several bugs with the software including issues related to credit cards billing REST API integrations and live data updates to the browser Software Developer ONE20 Inc December 2016 to March 2017 Greater MinneapolisSt Paul Area With One20 I helped maintain their existing applications including a Java REST API and Wordpress sites I also helped design their new mobile application Software Developer Flywheelio August 2016 to November 2016 Greater MinneapolisSt Paul Area At Flywheel I created a RAML specification for the Flywheel REST API I also helped automate tests and fixed bugs in the software The REST API was written in Python built on webapp2 and deployed with docker Software Developer Python Hurricane Labs November 2014 to July 2016 work from home I built custom solutions for Hurricane Labs usually involving Python and HTTP APIs I also did a lot of DevOps work helping to package and deploy applications or manage resources in AWS A few projects I completed include Built production quality HTTP APIs in Python running on EC2 Wrote custom software to back up network devices and store the backups in SAN Refactored and updated the customer portal website Django More than halved the home page load time and migrated the application to EC2 Planned and executed transition from legacy inhouse ticketing software to Zendesk including custom integration into the portal website and data migration from the legacy system Introduced automated monitoring of application errors substantially improving customer experience when they have an error in the website Wrote several opensource Python libraries used both internally and externally Reverse engineered the undocumented install process for some legacy applications and automated it to a oneclick build Software Developer Python Digi International July 2014 to November 2014 Develop and maintain embedded Python solutions running on Linux Accomplishments Designed a framework for building python packages that recursively installs versioncontrolled dependencies with pip runs tests with nose and builds documentation with Sphinx Helped design and build a Python solution to monitor Digi products and report metrics to our SaaS offering called Device Cloud Designed and built a Python solution to allow interfacing with the cell modem in various Digi products via the serial port Helped build a custom web server written in Python designed to serve pages in a lowresource environment such as on Digi devices Engineer Telsasoft October 2013 to July 2014 Develop and maintain monitoring software used by regional cell phone carriers to gain insights into their network health and performance Accomplishments Quickly learned legacy code base written in Python and running on Linux Selfprioritized time while combating regression in legacy code Wrote dropin replacement for the network health component of our software increasing performance enough to shift bottleneck to a different component The new network health component also allowed better data retention and recovery in the event of an error inspection of our running system and the automatic generation of useful test cases based on production behavior Decreased time required to create a new network health plugin to 23 days down from 2 weeks in old framework Created plugins for the network performance portion of our software used to monitor things like data throughput and call success rate on the cell networks Enterprise
