2010 to Present Description INET is a web based application that enables users to send shipments with out the need for visiting a station and at the comfort of their home Users can create shipment using an existing FedEx Account Number or using a Credit Card In general the application has the following features Create Shipment Return Shipment Save for later View Pending Shipments Displaying History of Shipments Print shipment Edit the Shipment Cancel the Shipment The FedEx Ship Manager at FedExcom INET is an online shipping system which is one of FedEx internal service consumers of the FedEx ESOA Enterprise Business Service layerStyle Architecture It consists of two major parts Ajaxbased Rich Browser User Interfaces Presentation tier at Weblogic web container based on Struts framework This application Supports pass key as well as nonpass key customer for shipment This also supports save for later option where customer can place there orders later stored in Database but not yet shipped My Role 1 Involved in designing developing testing for the moduleBig SRS Mail Room taking full ownership on the assigned modules and managing team members and to get work done from team members 2 Completed Translation project which is required to convert valuesfields into different localeslanguages Got appreciation from customer for implementing Translation code with in 15 days

Inventory Logistics Product of NextJet Sr Software Engg FedEX India Bangalore Karnataka April 2007 to Present Environment JavaJ2EE Windows Linux Skill JSF struts EJB JSP Hibernate Oracle Role Sr Developer Designing Developing and testing modules Description This project is designed and developed for FedEx to place an order for the packages which are sending from the customers This project initially developed by NextJet Company using Struts Framework EJB as middleware oracle as backend Due to increase in load for the application which was taking lot of time FedEx planned for new framework which work faster than existing so they decided to come up with JSF framework Hibernate oracle Basically this project used to send orders for the packages from source to destination User enters source place and destination place This project will decide the path which is optimum among all the paths and the price for the optimum path O2S Order Optimization System This is done by PCMiller algorithm This finds shortest path from the already existing paths This module is called routing User can select for different routing too if heshe is not satisfied for the existing one Currently we have 4 type of orders selection Inventory Orders Outbound orders only Return Orders Inbound Order Only Transportation Orders Exchange Advance Exchange Orders Inbound and Outbound Orders

modules FedEX US March 2007 to October 2007 Description This project developed for FedEx EMEA Europe Middle East Asia This project is basically used for searching and sorting the parcels which are sent from one end before sending the parcels to other side Before reaching destination there may be chances from CUSTOMS end for verifying the parcels This project allows them to verify the parcels which are blocked based on certain criteria And also it will send the parcels through HUB Where sorting will takes place This application will also list the Missing parcels Expected Arrived etc along with in which Flighttruck the parcels arriveddeparture My Role 1 Manifest Scrolling This is Web module developed using STRUTS framework to show all the parcels to the user along with their information

used by Qwest telecom software service Previously employees are using emails to send the request related to Human Resource department For ex Some employees have not received Confirmation letter Reimbursement claims By using this project we can send the request to HRDept instead through email Users of this project will of three types 1 Employee of the Qwest 2 HRTeam members of the Qwest 3 HRTeam Lead of the Qwest Employee has the rights to raise a ticketrequest related to HR Department Another option for user is heshe can view the requests or Reports along with the Status HR Team members involved in these issues to solve the problems of the employees If not then these issues are escalated to HR Lead HR Lead looks into these issues and heshe will take necessary actions to solve the issues and also they can decide the performance of the HRTeam members Environment Java 14 J2EE 13 JSP Servlets EJB Struts Weblogic application server 81 Oracle 9i Eclipse 32 XML HTML CSS Ant This project is basically to get the effective time utilization of the AIP those who are supporting the Application This project gives the number of hours that employee worked for that week Using this project higher management can decide whether they need to add some extra task to that teamemployee if that team had done fewer tasks Or the can add some resources to avoid he burden of the employees

2010 to Present Description INET is a web based application that enables users to send shipments with out the need for visiting a station and at the comfort of their home Users can create shipment using an existing FedEx Account Number or using a Credit Card In general the application has the following features Create Shipment Return Shipment Save for later View Pending Shipments Displaying History of Shipments Print shipment Edit the Shipment Cancel the Shipment The FedEx Ship Manager at FedExcom INET is an online shipping system which is one of FedEx internal service consumers of the FedEx ESOA Enterprise Business Service layerStyle Architecture It consists of two major parts Ajaxbased Rich Browser User Interfaces Presentation tier at Weblogic web container based on Struts

Developer Designing Developing and testing modules Description This project is designed and developed for FedEx to place an order for the packages which are sending from the customers This project initially developed by NextJet Company using Struts Framework EJB as middleware oracle as backend Due to increase in load for the application which was taking lot of time FedEx planned for new framework which work faster than existing so they decided to come up with JSF framework Hibernate oracle Basically this project used to send orders for the packages from source to destination User enters source place and destination place This project will decide the path which is optimum among all the paths and the price for the optimum path O2S Order Optimization System This is done by PCMiller algorithm This finds shortest path from the already existing paths This module is called routing User can select for different routing too if heshe is not satisfied for the existing one Currently we have 4 type of orders selection Inventory Orders Outbound orders only Return Orders Inbound Order Only Transportation Orders Exchange Advance Exchange Orders Inbound and Outbound Orders

sent from one end before sending the parcels to other side Before reaching destination there may be chances from CUSTOMS end for verifying the parcels This project allows them to verify the parcels which are blocked based on certain criteria And also it will send the parcels through HUB Where sorting will takes place This application will also list the Missing parcels Expected Arrived etc along with in which Flighttruck the parcels arriveddeparture My Role 1 Manifest Scrolling This is Web module developed using STRUTS framework to show all the parcels to the user along with their information
