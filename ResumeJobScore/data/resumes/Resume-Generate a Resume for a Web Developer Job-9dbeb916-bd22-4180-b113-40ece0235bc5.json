development and testing of application developed using agile methodology Created userfriendly GUI interface and Web pages using HTML Angular JS Node JS JQuery Ajax and JavaScript Defined new validations through Angular JS for the form field validation implemented through HTML Used Spring MVC and Dependency Injection for handling presentation and business logic To maintain loose coupling between layers published the business layer as services and injected the necessary dependent components using Spring IOC and published crosscutting concerns like Logging User Interface exceptions Transactions using Spring AOP Integrated Spring DAO for data access using Hibernate Used Spring Security for Authentication and Authorization of the application Implemented persistence framework using Hibernate Handled Transaction Management using the provided data source Extensively used JSON to parse the data from server side to satisfy the business requirement Responsible for designing Hibernate mapping files based on business logic and Object relationships Integrated spring and hibernate together and worked on developing backend components and services using Hibernate and spring Extensively used HQL and SQL for querying databases Developed Message Driven Bean for asynchronous sending Messages using JMS Consumed Web Services to interact with other external interfaces in order to exchange the data in different forms by using RESTful service Used Spring JMS module for lookup for the queues and MDBs for the listeners Established Database Connectivity using JDBC Hibernate OR mapping with Spring ORM for Oracle Packaged and deployed the application in IBM WebSphere Written LINUX shell scripts to identify user login information Used Log4J for application logging and notification tracking mechanisms Used Maven tools for building and deploying Web applications Analysis and Bug fixing of the production problems and defects along with enhancements Implemented JUNIT test cases for unit testing and Suites for an end to end testing Used JIRA for tracking the Project Stories in Agile Methodology Used Tortoise SVN to maintain the version of the files and took the responsibility to do the code merges from branch to trunk and creating a new branch when new feature implementation starts Environment HTML5 CSS3 AngularJS NodeJS JSON XML AJAX JQuery Struts Hibernate Spring MVC RESTful

effective processing of day to day business activities in the company like leave management project management and resource management etc Responsibilities Understanding and analyzing the basic requirements By using Servlets and JSP implemented serverside programs Involved in design development and validation of User Interface by using HTML JavaScript XML and CSS Performed the database access tasks using JDBC and other related information from autogenerated files Implemented PLSQL stored procedures and triggers Used JDBC prepared statements to call from servlets for database access Developed servlets session and Entity Beans handling business logic and data Involved in the design and documentation of the stored procedures Developed Action Forms Action Classes and helper classes by using Struts Used UML to develop Use case diagram class diagram and sequence diagrams Worked on database interaction layer for insertions updating and retrieval operations of data from database by using queries and writing stored procedures Deployed Enterprise application using WebLogic Application Server Involved in writing Junit test Cases and used Log4J for any errors in the application
