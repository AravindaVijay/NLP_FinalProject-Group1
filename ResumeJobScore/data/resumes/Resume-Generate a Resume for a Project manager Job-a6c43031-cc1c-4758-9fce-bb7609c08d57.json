need to operate with low power many devices use simplified security measures to secure the data during transmission While Bluetooth the primary method of communication includes certain security measures as part of the format they are insufficient to fully secure the connection and the data transmitted Users must be made aware of the potential security threats to the information communicated by the wearable as well as be empowered and engaged to protect it In this paper we propose a method of identifying insecure environments through crowdsourced data allowing wearable consumers to deploy an application on their base system eg a smart phone that alerts when in the presence of a security threat We examine two different machine learning methods for classifying the environment and interacting with the users as well as evaluating the potential uses for both algorithms Anomaly detection sensors for a Modbusbased oil and gas wellmonitoring system 201906 Accepted for presentation at the 2nd International Conference on Data intelligence and Security June 2019 Abstract This paper describes a network sensor that has been specifically designed to operate within an existing wellmonitoring infrastructure Network traffic and flow features are extracted in realtime and compared against preset and moving averages to detect and report anomalies A prototype has been tested using the Modbus protocol and network traffic covering several months of operations In order to avoid potential impact on the production environment scripts captured network packets that were then

2019 to Present I created a web service for a startup undisclosedconfidential identity as a fullstack PythonHTML developer using the Django framework Open Source Programmer Present I created two open source projects bbtools contributorcomaintainer bbtools is a parsing engine for Arc System Works ASW games files I extracted script files from memory in various Guilty Gear titles and deciphered character script functions I also updated the old Blazblue script parserrebuilder to the latest version of the game and added additional features I completed the parsing and rebuilding to facilitate the modification of a character script with easytounderstand Python pseudocode that gets translated back into the ASW script format The entire project was written in Python 27 httpsgithubcomdantarionbbtools rev2wakeuptool creator rev2wakeuptool is a tool that uses the training mode recordingplayback feature and input simulation to make the training dummy do whatever the user wants upon standing up from getting knocked down This added industry standard for fighting games brings Guilty Gear closer to par with games like Street Fighter V as well as accelerates the competitive communitys knowledge of the game As of 2018 the project no longer uses a highlevel librarybased hook but rather implements a lowlevel assembly hook that facilitates playback httpsgithubcomLabreezyrev2wakeuptool Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge TURC Dr Rose Gamble Mentor University of Tulsa Tulsa OK June 2015 to December 2018 Applying Machine Learning Techniques and Relational Databases to RealWorld Data 2015 I created a twoclass support vector machine SVM that predicted collaborative relationships between musicians by examining past collaborations and computed the Bacon number or degrees of separation between musicians with a relational database The SVM predicted 81 positive cases correctly in a test sample Programs Python Azure ML Studio Java C Applying Machine Algorithms to RealWorld Data 2016 I used Azure ML Studio to detect anomalies in network traffic Used Structured Query Language SQL and Python and cowrote a research paper submitted and accepted to HICSS50 Title Towards Predicting Secure Environments for Wearable Devices Programs Python Azure ML Studio SQL Truck Network Experiment Editing FrontendCAN Heavy Vehicle Experiment Editing Frontend 20172018 I created a secure website that could successfully transform a Control Area Network CAN exploit into a physical attack on a truck that can be verified with visualizations and real system behavior After ten weeks the website became fully integrated with the trucksimulating hardware and basic visualizations were implemented to verify that the hardware communicated correctly to the front end and outputted useful data Programs Python Django SQLite Javascript The final portion of this TURC involved implementing new attacks and practical means to execute them through the web frontend a project expected to yield a scholarly paper I also worked with packet capture files and replaying traffic to stimulate an actual network which involved shell scripting bash and Python Programs Python Tutorial Developer University of Tulsa Department of Computer Science Tulsa OK June 2017 to September 2017 I volunteered to create a Django tutorial in the summer of 2017 for firstsemester Seniors in the University of Tulsa Computer Science degree program as a rising Senior The tutorial simplifies and walks through the creation of a basic website Concepts introduced URL and URL Patterns Views Models Forms Querying Models and Generic Django Views httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1n6xn8nhisnxN2deLVQAZWTb1Vex6GHPEldkcAj_wTwedit Web Developer Univeristy of Tulsa Tulsa OK 2018 I created a website with five other students to assist in the transition to the practical application of computer science concepts for firstyear comp sci students I worked on the website admin page created an SQLite backend as well as a Django REST API that communicated with the reactjs frontend Education Bachelor of Science in Computer Science The University of Tulsa Tulsa OK December 2018

on AI and Machine Learning Publications Towards Predicting Secure Environments for Wearable Devices httphdlhandlenet1012541321 2016 Wearable devices have become more common for the average consumer As devices need to operate with low power many devices use simplified security measures to secure the data during transmission While Bluetooth the primary method of communication includes certain security measures as part of the format they are insufficient to fully secure the connection and the data transmitted Users must be made aware of the potential security threats to the information communicated by the wearable as well as be empowered and engaged to protect it In this paper we propose a method of identifying insecure environments through crowdsourced data allowing wearable consumers to deploy an application on their base system eg a smart phone that alerts when in the presence of a security threat We examine two different machine learning methods for classifying the environment and interacting with the users as well as evaluating the potential uses for both algorithms Anomaly detection sensors for a Modbusbased oil and gas wellmonitoring system 201906 Accepted for presentation at the 2nd International Conference on Data intelligence and Security June 2019 Abstract This paper describes a network sensor that has been specifically designed to operate within an existing wellmonitoring infrastructure Network traffic and flow features are extracted in realtime and compared against preset and moving averages to detect and report anomalies A prototype has been tested using the Modbus protocol and network traffic covering several months of operations In order to avoid potential impact on the production environment scripts captured network packets that were then replayed on the IMUNES network emulator Preliminary results have identified useful metrics for anomaly detection in a production",
