Madison MS February 2019 to Present I was brought in as a member of a team of 4 server administrators to assist with implementing a new server and storage infrastructure In addition to implementing a new infrastructure we have also been migrating from a legacy Microsoft Active Directory domain to separate from the L3 Vertex business relationship to a new Microsoft Active Directory domain that belongs to Vertex Aerospace The migration has recently been completed Now that the AD migration is complete we have turned our focus to continue the infrastructure build out which consists of migrating legacy servers from the old hardware to the new hardware PtoV old servers to VMware 67 virtual machines migrating from the legacy backup solution to new backup solution migrating from legacy iSCSI spindle storage to fibre channel flash storage I am also assisting with the build out of all the new subnets and DNS records in Infoblox away from the legacy IPAM DNS DHCP solution building new

to migrate and combine into one entity This effort consists of migrating servers from existing Microsoft Active Directory domains to new joined Active Directory domain user and data migrations During my time at Baptist Ive recommended designed and implemented a new storage backup and archive environment to remove unnecessary complexity and interdependencies in addition to saving us administration hours maintenance costs downtime and real estate Implemented a server and switch cabling system that others notice due to the clean design without the cable clutter in each rack We went from backing up only 100 servers to over 600 servers and nearly all our SQL databases due to the new backup solution Successfully recovered all data that was held for ransom without having to payout any attackers

Madison MS February 2019 to Present I was brought in as a member of a team of 4 server administrators to assist with implementing a new server and storage infrastructure In addition to implementing a new infrastructure we have also been migrating from a legacy Microsoft Active Directory domain to separate from the L3 Vertex business relationship to a new Microsoft Active Directory domain that belongs to Vertex Aerospace The migration has recently been completed Now that the AD migration is complete we have turned our focus to continue the infrastructure build out which consists of migrating legacy servers from the old hardware to the new hardware PtoV old servers to VMware 67 virtual machines migrating from the legacy backup solution to new backup solution migrating from legacy iSCSI spindle storage to fibre channel flash storage I am also assisting with the build out of all the new subnets and DNS records in Infoblox away from the legacy IPAM DNS DHCP solution building new
