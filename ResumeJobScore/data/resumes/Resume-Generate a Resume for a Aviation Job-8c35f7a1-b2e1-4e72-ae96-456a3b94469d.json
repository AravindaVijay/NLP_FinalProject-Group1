support in part design using CATIA computer aided three dimensional interactive applications for aircraft implementation Participated in the improvements of engineering software and designed several components for fuel controls starters coordinators and fuel nozzles for different turboprop engines Developed linearization software to help the pre test process of 501 coordinators Contact Leonardo Marcano mobile 1  Company Name City Aerospace Engineer 01 2014 to 01 2015 Member of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades Throughout this process computational fluid dynamic software STARCCM and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different geometries inside a wind tunnel Pressures temperatures velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries This project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency It is not a secret in today s industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine Also it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels Upon this experiment a research paper was written and patented Education and Training

efficiency It is not a secret in today s industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling impingement which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine Also it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels Upon this experiment a research paper was written and patented Education and Training
