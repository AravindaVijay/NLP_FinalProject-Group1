professional field Additional Information The type of opportunity I am seeking probably would not exist in a company with less than 2000 employees I need to be in a role where both my AccountingFinance and Systems background are needed and has opportunity for growth I am very good at working with TypeA personalities in both Accounting and Systems because I know how to frame the questions While my resume includes a number of environments and technologies such as Oracle EBS Python and Angular do not assume that these are the only technologies I will work with or these are the only technologies I have used I have experience with many other technologies but I dont want to convey a greater sense of knowledge than I have achieved Finally I left Burns and McDonnell due to the 2 hour round trip commute While I may consider temporary positions with a 2 hour commute I will not consider any positions with more than a 1 hour round trip commute Downtown Kansas City or the
