the perimeter of the Netcool environment that would be able to handle flooding events as soon as they occurred Responsible for creating an application that read in data from log files which contained the individual disk utilization across all servers in our environment on a per partition basis and dynamically produce a graph all via an online interface using HTMLCGI This application also included
