shipping Replication Monitored the daily maintenance weakly maintenance and monitoring jobs Took a lead role in troubleshooting the performance issues on the database as well as instance level using the native tools profiler PERFMON and activity monitor Worked extensively in maintaining the index fragmentation by regularly scheduling for the reorgrebuild of indexes based on the fragmentation level and updated the stats Used the new concepts of SQL server 2008 and DMVs for monitoring the fragmentation of indexes blocks memory page splits Log space of all the databases Monitored the TEMPDB growth and resized it by adding files in order to increase the performance by parallel process of data storage with in TEMPDB Managed a wide range of relational databases and utilized proprietary DBA tools and utilities to monitor the health of production database systems Proactively Managed the databases ie managed databases tables log file allocation and space utilization identify table growth file growth for table or index reorganization fatal errors failed jobs integrity violations performance issues and data abnormalities Provided 247 support for the DSS customers by actively monitoring
