Capability for Memory This project involves the Designing of 64 bit Risc Processor detect the faults present in the Memory and also to repair the detected faults Memory repair is the necessary since just detecting the faults is no longer sufficient for Socs hence both diagnosis and repair algorithms are required April 2008Aug 2008 Project Tracking of Position using GSM GPS using Microcontroller AT89C51 This project we have two modules one is GPS and the second one is GSM We monitor the latitude and longitude of an area by using the GPS modem The GPS receiver will continuously receive this latitude longitude from the satellite and transmit those values to the microcontroller through serial communication By using those values we can measure the position of that objects GPS provides the best support for the navigators including Earth Water and Air by determining the users exact position GPS determine the position of the user with different coordinates accurately If our base station needs the information about vehicle location it just sends a sms to the system then the system send the latitude and longitude values as a sms using GSM Course Certification Details ADCA certificate

Capability for Memory This project involves the Designing of 64 bit Risc Processor detect the faults present in the Memory and also to repair the detected faults Memory repair is the necessary since just detecting the faults is no longer sufficient for Socs hence both diagnosis and repair algorithms are required April 2008Aug 2008 Project Tracking of Position using GSM GPS using Microcontroller AT89C51 This project we have two modules one is GPS and the second one is GSM We monitor the latitude and longitude of an area by using the GPS modem The GPS receiver will continuously receive this latitude longitude from the satellite and transmit those values to the microcontroller through serial communication By using those values we can measure the position of that objects GPS provides the best support for the navigators including Earth Water and Air by determining the users exact position GPS determine the position of the user with different coordinates accurately If our base station needs the information about vehicle location it just sends a sms to the system then the system send the latitude and longitude values as a sms using GSM Course Certification Details ADCA certificate
