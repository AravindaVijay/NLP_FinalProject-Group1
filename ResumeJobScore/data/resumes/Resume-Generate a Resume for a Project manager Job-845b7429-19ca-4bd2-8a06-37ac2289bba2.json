SEAL3 Specialized Engineering Analysis L3 Project Developed a documented standardized process for creating lite installable engineering packages so engineering applications can run as clientserver apps based on GE technical manager specs Wrote C applications and htavbscript script tools to generate msi files and wrapper command scripts for client installs Developed and maintain many htavbscripts and command scripts utilized in deployment processes Developed C applications that run from the server for engineers to select engineering applications to install and for the team to help maintain advertised packaged software on servers that received the deployed software Rigorously followed workflow process used to track the life cycle of packaged applications from development testing staging and deployment to production for deployment to servershares globally Developed other htavbscript scripting tools to perform different functionalities used in the packaging deployment reporting or software installation processes Figured out a way to programmatically add the Engineering shortcut folder as a tool bar and to pin shortcuts to Windows 10 taskbar set this up before releasing

and development Key clients include General Electric Pella Windows and Doors and Electric Power Research Institute Met challenges and deadlines and consistently delivered for the client Strongly motivated to automate processes and produce high quality results in a timely manner Effectively prioritizes communicates and resolves customer issues Played a significant role in the standardization process of packaging engineering software used at GE Energy Aviation and other GE businesses Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Software Developer Currently Available for Opportunities Albany NY March 2018 to Present In the meantime since being laid off besides looking for a job Ive been taking different courses through NYS Labors Metrix Learning program on Skillsoft and Microsoft Virtual Academy like JavaScript HTML5 CSS3 Python C Net MVC 5 Entity Framework and others Ive also been doing C coding challenges on CodeWarscom and HackerRankcom Lately Ive been working on a personal project to develop a web application using C Net MVC 5 Entity Framework and MS Sql Express Engineering Software Packager Logic Technology Inc Schenectady NY July 2005 to December 2017 General Electric SEAL3 Specialized Engineering Analysis L3 Project Developed a documented standardized process for creating lite installable engineering packages so engineering applications can run as clientserver apps based on GE technical manager specs Wrote C applications and htavbscript script tools to generate msi files and wrapper command scripts for client installs Developed and maintain many htavbscripts and command scripts utilized in deployment processes Developed C applications that run from the server for engineers to select engineering applications to install and for the team to help maintain advertised packaged software on servers that received the deployed software Rigorously followed workflow process used to track the life cycle of packaged applications from development testing staging and deployment to production for deployment to servershares globally Developed other htavbscript scripting tools to perform different functionalities used in the packaging deployment reporting or software installation processes Figured out a way to programmatically add the Engineering shortcut folder as a tool bar and to pin shortcuts to Windows 10 taskbar set this up before releasing Windows 10 to the engineering community Developed an htavbscript tool to generate mst and Install cmd overlay files to make existing clientserver packages stay persistent in the VDI nonpersistent world Eliminated the need for users to keep reinstalling software Developed a process and scripts along with modifying existing Copied As Is deployment code for backend of AUTOPILOT process allowing technical managers to enable deployment of applications or subfolders of application folders automatically eliminating need to submit a deployment request Often complimented by customer users and technical managers for high quality deliverables and services The C Net client application tools were created using Windows Forms XML was used to store and retrieve data between the different tools Some of the tools used generated command scripts used in the lite installations Created a C Windows service that would monitor a configuration file that another team would modify to autogenerate their installation msi files for their applications Used TortiseSVN as the repository for the software tools created then switched over to GITHub near the end of the project Near the end of the project GE leadership instituted leading an Agile Scrum process using Rally software Software Developer Logic Technology Inc Schenectady NY July 1999 to March 2005 Pella Windows and Doors OMS

software to install OMS application to either the client or server machines Performed the application release builds by downloading source code based on version labels from SourceSafe build the install package and uploaded the install package to Pella Pella Windows and Doors PCS Project Jul 2000 to Jun 2004 Software Developer Technical Lead for rewriting application from Visual C to Visual C based on OMS architecture Separated application business logic from user interface for easier future transition to a web based application Worked on enhancements and bug fixes upgraded clientserver installs made modifications to the Sybase database and created and built version releases for the clientserver Rewrote other related software to allow interfacing with other Pella applications
