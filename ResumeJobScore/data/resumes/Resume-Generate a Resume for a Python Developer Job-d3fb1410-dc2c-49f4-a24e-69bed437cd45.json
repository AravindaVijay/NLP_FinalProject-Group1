suggest books to users based on their ratings on Amazon product data Compared the predictive accuracy of various collaborative filtering techniques like user based collaborative filtering item based filtering matrix factorization and analyzed the performance using parameter tuning Academic Project FacebookTwitter Friend List Prediction Python IIT Chicago IL Predicted the probability that two people are friends in Facebook and Twitter using weighted jacquard similarity score by collecting their connections through their REST APIs Created a Predictive model with an accuracy of 88 in python Academic Project Predict Popularity of ActorsCelebrities using Twitter API Online Social Network Analysis IIT Chicago IL Collected tweets regionally made clusters of users using Girvan Newman cluster analysis and classified tweets using Machine learning models like Support Vector Machine naive based logistic regression for predicting the sentiment of tweets Computed average testing accuracy of each model over kfold Crossvalidation and made accuracy comparison analysis and built graphs using Python Academic Project OS Design Implementation in Minux IIT Chicago IL Implemented Shell with command suggestion feature Message Queue with its supported IPC System calls and implemented File System Tools with many added functionalities using C in Minux OS Academic Project Implementing Static Hashing schemes IIT Chicago IL The aim of this project is to implement static Hashing schemes of two specific types open addressing and chaining using Java For the open addressing hashing scheme Linear probing Quadratic probing and Double Hashing were implemented A good hash function and a bad hash function has been used and the subsequent results have been compared It was observed that bad hash functions can lead to clustering and searching in linear time in case of Linear Probing Finding out the best running times in our implementation in case of open addressing to determine when to rehash and increase the size of the map Academic Project Online Ticket Booking System IIT Chicago IL An userfriendly website to book tickets online create and update user information review the

path in a network dealing realtime scenarios IIT Chicago IL Implementing Dijkstras algorithms with cost effective path from a specified source to the destination and display why the route is chosen by creating connection table of a node If there are more than one shortest paths available find all from a source node to a destination node Function to modify a link weight of existing topology and find a new collection table and shortest paths from a source node to a destination node display entire process step by step automatically Adding a node to the existing topology and find a new collection table and shortest paths from a source node to a destination node display entire process step by step automatically Displaying Multiple paths exist between two directly connected nodes build a connection table for this condition one or more of the paths go down build a new connection table and shortest paths from a source node to destination node Education Masters of Science in Computer
