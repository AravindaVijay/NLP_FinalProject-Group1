and store in Db for further process Exposes different services to down stream systems Responsibilities Designed and developed multitier custom build workflow based web application Implemented an adaptor which receives inventory data from Kafka engine processed by Message Bus Message Bus was built using Spring Integration to dequeue inventory data from Kafka topics sends to different channels for parsing enrichment persisting into database Core Java with Concurrent API is used extensively for parallel processing and chunk processing Used Java 8 Lambda expressions and Stream API to support functionalstyle operations on streams of elements Worked on Java functional programming concepts like Streams Functional Interfaces new date time API and lambda expressions JProfiler is used to profile he application Memory view and CPU view and Thread view are used Used Angular router and implemented module wide routing and created different forms using Angular data driven and template driven forms Developed Angular Components Services and Filters and took part in developing unit test and integration test cases using Jasmine Karma Used Spring Boot which is radically faster in building cloud Micro Services and develop Spring based application with very less configuration Developed Micro services APIs using Spring Cloud Spring Security Spring Boot Spring Integration Design
