Framework Rest Services Microservices Development Methodology Agile Scrum Engineer Software Cisco Systems San Jose CA February 2015 to July 2016 Project Application Centric Cloud Infrastructure as a Service Description Its a platform for Infrastructure provisioning on the cloud It follows a top down approach to define the cloud as opposed to the bottom up approach used with infrastructure centric cloud With top down approach we first define the application then define the platform needed by the application and finally the computing infrastructure for the platform This approach improves auto scaling and fault tolerance of the application based on different events generated by the monitoring subsystems Responsibility Design and Development Implemented the Front End and the Middle Layer

Plugin This plugin enabled the ETL framework to use Hadoop cluster as Data Source Environment Java 16 SWT Apache PIG Map ReduceHadoop Senior Software Engineer SIT Mobile August 2008 to December 2010 Awarded for Outstanding Overall Performance for the year 2009 Project XSIT 2 This is an SMPP SMS gateway It provides an intelligent routing mechanism for the message depending on different parameters such as country and type of message It also provides a messaging solution by providing a platform through which the client can send bulk messages to the end user This application takes care of routing through the best possible route ensuring timely delivery of messages and shielding the user from the complexity of message delivery Responsibility Design and Development Served as the Development lead for the entire project Re factored the entire application from a Monolithic design to Distributed and component based architecture Designed the application to be scalable Developed JDBC DAOs wrote advanced SQL and PLSQL stored procedures on database systems Environment Java 16 JMS Fuse 50029 My SQL SMPP XML JAXB Software Engineer Persistent Systems Ltd June 2007 to May 2008 Project Mobile Number Portability Application for Australia MNPAA This MNP Australia application allows clients QoS to send DNS ENUM style queries over UDP and find out which operator a certain MSISDN mobile number belongs to MNPAA interacts with the paradigm One data feed servers at regular configured intervals to import update on ported mobile numbers Role Design and Development Implemented the Module which interacted with the network operators servers to receive the update on the ported number Implemented the module which serves the SMS gateway with the operator ID for the requested Mobile Number Embedded the SNMP agent in the application which provided the status of the application using SNMP Traps Used MULE ESB to connect different components of the application Deployed the application on Apache Tomcat Developed build scripts using apache ant Implemented the SOAP Interfaces for the Number Portability Services Technology Core Java 15 Servlets 23 Mule ESB SNMPSOAP Web services Project Asterix PBX Services Role Developer This project basically enables an organization to provide PBX functionalities such as voicemail and call conferencing through a Web interface The User can listen to his voicemail or set up a conference among SIPenabled phones through a web interface Role Development Wrote an overlay over the PBX server which would enable services like Call conference through a web interface Configured the PBX to for conference Developed a Web based management plane over the PBX which would allow the user to set up conference call over the web Environment Java 15 Mobicents
