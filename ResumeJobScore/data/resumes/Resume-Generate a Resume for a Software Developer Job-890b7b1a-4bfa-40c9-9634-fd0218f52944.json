to PythonWrote a tool achieving 80 of this process Test Tools Capabilities SW EngineerSenior Developer Advanced CPU March 2014 to June 2016 Expanded an LLVM compiler and linking locator Linux and Windows hosted in C and assembly Resulting tests executed on hardware emulators and simulators Much target info was available at compile time so references by class generated as immediate values successive value uses were deeply compiler optimized For PCI device config register access no register read was performed the value was available at compile time This system drastically reduced test execution time and size 1 Expert owner of linker and memory allocation across all address spaces developing hardwarespecific detection and management of diverse memory and MMIO regions used by framework and tests 2 Made numerous paging changes including introduction of nonidentity mapped support 3 Dramatically improved devdebug by adding DWARF sourcelevel symbolic debug data for sourcelevel debug Rewrote object writer modules with inheritance and derived classes writing data into ELF3264 files Complete ownership required research planning initiating beta deployment and coordination across organizations Leveraged capabilities by engaging groups that create or test DWARF Defined QA testing to leverage Linux SDT extensively Result was maximum confidence in file format accuracy 4 Produced initial VTd user language interface and linker VTd paging support 5 Added framework for all special memory regions eg PRMRR graphics aperture cache slice concurrency etc 6 Provided testcard

operating system software tools and applications in Linux Windows other operating systems or embeddedfirmware Eager to work as a contractor fulltime or parttime employee I hope for a mutually beneficial work environment wherein the depth of my skills is useful and valued Very knowledgeable of PC IA32 and EM64T CPU microprocessors chipsets and systems using them other CPUs and microcontroller use also Highly proficient in LinuxUnixCASMC environment good in Windows too Broad understanding of software engineering refined by decades of challenges across diverse projects Strong work ethic taking unparalleled pride in my work consistently delivering excellence I assume responsibility and tenaciously drive toward project goals Im known for being well organized in everything I am involved in Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Validation Engineer Python Automation Intel Hillsboro OR May 2018 to December 2018 Developed executed and debugged FPGA validation system on LinuxInfrastructure and tests were Python with some large Bash scriptsBuilt and configured Linux systems installed Linux OS drivers and packagesDebugged failures related to OS drivers automation and network 1 Developed DLA Deep Learning Algorithm regression testing and installer 2 Wrote validation test specifications 3 Created PCI error and other HW error detection run parallel with all tests 4 Dramatically improved dev triage and debug by instrumenting automation error exits 5 Standardized log file and console output similarly 6 Foresaw a tool to install automation drivers and configure systems for FPGA execution 7 Envisioned test execution supervisor and a regression analysis tool to gather and summarize results 8 Translated large primary regression tests Bash to PythonWrote a tool achieving 80 of this process Test Tools Capabilities SW EngineerSenior Developer Advanced CPU March 2014 to June 2016 Expanded an LLVM compiler and linking locator Linux and Windows hosted in C and assembly Resulting tests executed on hardware emulators and simulators Much target info was available at compile time so references by class generated as immediate values successive value uses were deeply compiler optimized For PCI device config register access no register read was performed the value was available at compile time This system drastically reduced test execution time and size 1 Expert owner of linker and memory allocation across all address spaces developing hardwarespecific detection and management of diverse memory and MMIO regions used by framework and tests 2 Made numerous paging changes including introduction of nonidentity mapped support 3 Dramatically improved devdebug by adding DWARF sourcelevel symbolic debug data for sourcelevel debug Rewrote object writer modules with inheritance and derived classes writing data into ELF3264 files Complete ownership required research planning initiating beta deployment and coordination across organizations Leveraged capabilities by engaging groups that create or test DWARF Defined QA testing to leverage Linux SDT extensively Result was maximum confidence in file format accuracy 4 Produced initial VTd user language interface and linker VTd paging support 5 Added framework for all special memory regions eg PRMRR graphics aperture cache slice concurrency etc 6 Provided testcard use generalizing detection config and grammar for memory thereon 7 Eliminated risk of linker overlaps from complex resource interactions and linkage to other tool outputs System SoftwareTool
