tracing mechanisms Performed testing using JUnit and tested various test cases using Seleniumand on service providers like Browser Stack Used Cucumber to write acceptance tests for web application Used JIRA to track bugs prioritize and discuss teams work in full context Environment Java HTML CSS Java script JSON XML AJAX jQuery DAO Hibernate Spring MVC EJB Cucumber Web Sphere Server MySQL Server Selenium EJB JMS Ant Eclipse IDE JIRA LINUX Web ServiceSoap Java Developer Info Tech Hyderabad Telangana August 2013 to March 2014 Description The objective of Item Management is to setup maintain and share Item information in a flexible system that easily supports Unilevers growth increases speed to market and improves data accuracy while reducing user workload Guided Setup is one module of the project which functions as a wizard to complete the configuration and creation of various types of items like Single Items Multiple Items and Assortment Items Responsibilities Analysis design and development of application based on J2EE and design patterns Involved in all phases of SDLC Software Development Life Cycle and used oops concepts Developed user interface using JSP HTML JavaScript and CSS Involved in developing functional model object model and dynamic model using UML Development of the Java classes to be used in JSP and Servlets Implemented asynchronous functionalities like email notification using JMS Implemented Multithreading to achieve consistent concurrency in the application Handled the exceptions using try and catch blocks Used CollectionInterface to develop internal logic of the application SOAP service created with top down approach using Apache Axis2 framework with marshaling and unmarshaling and producing WSDL file Dependency injection using Factory Design Pattern and Spring IOC Using Spring Batch and JPA and implemented services to do backend processing Exposed and implemented topdown and bottomup SOAP web services Used the spring framework for managing the navigation and page flow and working with applets development Created SQL queries and used PLSQL stored procedures Used Test Driven Development approach and wrote many unit and integration test cases Involved in writing flexible queries at DAO layer Used Eclipse as IDE tool to develop the application and JIRA for bug and issue tracking Followed strategy of TDD using Junit based testing where writing test cases first and then writing logic based on test cases to reduce QA cost Used ANT tool for building and packaging the application
