receive applications sent by FFM and likewise send state or FFM applications back to CMS The Affordable Care Act or Obamacare includes both the individual mandate and the employer mandate The individual mandate requires that most Americans have qualifying health care coverage or potentially face a fine The employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more fulltime equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to their fulltime employees or potentially face a fine Form 1095 determines whether the employee or the employer have to pay a fine for failing to meet the individual mandate
