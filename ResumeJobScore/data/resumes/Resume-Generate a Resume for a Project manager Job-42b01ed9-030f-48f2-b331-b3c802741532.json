on Selenium testing framework JIRA was used to build an environment for development Assisted in reduction of cost and optimization of supplier selection for the CRM Applications Ensured high quality data collection and maintained the integrity of the data Cleaned data and processed third party spending data into maneuverable deliverables within specific formats with Excel macros and Python libraries Used several Python libraries like python numPY and matPlotLib Was involved in environment code installation as well as the SVN implementation and Saas Built all database mapping classes using Django models and Cassandra Used Pandas API to put the data in time series and tabular format for easy timestamp data manipulation and retrieval We recommend NLTK only as an education and research tool Its modularized structure makes it excellent for learning and exploring NLP concepts but its not meant for production Text Blob is built on top of NLTK and its more easilyaccessible This is our favorite library for fastprototyping or building applications that dont require highly optimized performance Beginners should start here Stanfords Core NLP is a Java library with Python wrappers Its in many existing production systems due to its speed SpaCy is a new NLP library thats designed to be fast streamlined and productionready Its not as widely adopted but if youre building a new application you should give it a try Gensim is most commonly used for topic modeling and similarity detection Its not a generalpurpose NLP library but for the tasks it does handle it does them well The list will only include databases that either classify themselves in their marketing material as time series or have been written about in a blog by a respected company as something they are

on Selenium testing framework JIRA was used to build an environment for development Assisted in reduction of cost and optimization of supplier selection for the CRM Applications Ensured high quality data collection and maintained the integrity of the data Cleaned data and processed third party spending data into maneuverable deliverables within specific formats with Excel macros and Python libraries Used several Python libraries like python numPY and matPlotLib Was involved in environment code installation as well as the SVN implementation and Saas Built all database mapping classes using Django models and Cassandra Used Pandas API to put the data in time series and tabular format for easy timestamp data manipulation and retrieval We recommend NLTK only as an education and research tool Its modularized structure makes it excellent for learning and exploring NLP concepts but its not meant for production Text Blob is built on top of NLTK and its more easilyaccessible This is our favorite library for fastprototyping or building applications that dont require highly optimized performance Beginners should start here Stanfords Core NLP is a Java library with Python wrappers Its in many existing production systems due to its speed SpaCy is a new NLP library thats designed to be fast streamlined and productionready Its not as widely adopted but if youre building a new application you should give it a try Gensim is most commonly used for topic modeling and similarity detection Its not a generalpurpose NLP library but for the tasks it does handle it does them well The list will only include databases that either classify themselves in their marketing material as time series or have been written about in a blog by a respected company as something they are using for time series data Storage efficiency is extremely important The purpose built TSDBs only consume a few bytes of storage per data point which is important when you start to add up the costs
