Hardware issues in case of appliances and software issues on VMs worked with the vendor to resolve both the software and hardware issues Troubleshooted the Anamoli threat stream Optilink software that runs on Arcsight connector that provides the threat fee data from Anamoli Identified the storage and capacity levels and worked with the storage teams towards increment of space as per the requirment Ensured that the SIEM is receiving the logs from the configured log sources from all the enviroments and are reporting to ESM Troubleshooted the log sources and the intermediate device specific issues any threat feed issues with the vendor Anamoli Installed the smart connectors and flex connectors modification of flex connector like parser mapping categorization etc deployed the modified flex connectors in Production Identified and Troubleshooted the connectors that are not being reported on ESM Creation of Dashboards alertsNotifications reports corelation rules etc has been done Upgraded
