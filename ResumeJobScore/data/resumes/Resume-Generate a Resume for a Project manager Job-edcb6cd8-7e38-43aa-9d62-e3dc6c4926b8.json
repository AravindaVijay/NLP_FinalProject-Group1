Use Test Driven Development to ensure compliance with SonarQube code standards and use Git as a revision control tool and to collaborate with fellow developers Masters Thesis North Carolina State University Applied Aerodynamics Laboratory Raleigh NC May 2015 to September 2016 A VortexLattice method based on Weissingers formulation Weissingers Lifting Line Theory was coded in FORTRAN and MATLAB to simulate inviscid fluid flow around a wing Propeller slipstream flow data obtained from XFOIL and XROTOR airfoil and propeller analysis tools respectively was input to the above inviscid code to mimic the effect of a propeller upstream of the wing Comparison of results from these simulations with existing CFD and experimental data showed several orders of magnitude reduction in simulation times with a reasonably accurate agreement in the results Preliminary wind tunnel tests were also conducted on a wing model with a separate propeller setup The propeller setup consisted of a mount which was designed using Creo CAD tool and was fabricated in the NCSU specialty trades fabrication shop by the technicians A factor of safety was assigned to the propeller mount while minimizing the surface area and modifying the design to ease the fabrication process Based on the results from the preliminary wind tunnel runs a modification to the design of the propeller mount was proposed to lower the turbulence in the slipstream induced by the mount Boeing student project Boeing Student Project 2011 to 2012 Boeing Student Project Oct 2011 April 2012 Kharagpur India Won the Boeing Student

Use Test Driven Development to ensure compliance with SonarQube code standards and use Git as a revision control tool and to collaborate with fellow developers Masters Thesis North Carolina State University Applied Aerodynamics Laboratory Raleigh NC May 2015 to September 2016 A VortexLattice method based on Weissingers formulation Weissingers Lifting Line Theory was coded in FORTRAN and MATLAB to simulate inviscid fluid flow around a wing Propeller slipstream flow data obtained from XFOIL and XROTOR airfoil and propeller analysis tools respectively was input to the above inviscid code to mimic the effect of a propeller upstream of the wing Comparison of results from these simulations with existing CFD and experimental data showed several orders of magnitude reduction in simulation times with a reasonably accurate agreement in the results Preliminary wind tunnel tests were also conducted on a wing model with a separate propeller setup The propeller setup consisted of a mount which was designed using Creo CAD tool and was fabricated in the NCSU specialty trades fabrication shop by the technicians A factor of safety was assigned to the propeller mount while minimizing the surface area and modifying the design to ease the fabrication process Based on the results from the preliminary wind tunnel runs a modification to the design of the propeller mount was proposed to lower the turbulence in the slipstream induced by the mount Boeing student project Boeing Student Project 2011 to 2012 Boeing Student Project Oct 2011 April 2012 Kharagpur India Won the Boeing Student
