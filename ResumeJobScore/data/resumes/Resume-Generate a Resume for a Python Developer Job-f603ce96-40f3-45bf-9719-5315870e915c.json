Prof JavaJ2EE Developer Nigel Frank International Limited December 2005 to 2008 Responsibilities Followed the Agile methodology iterative process for each of the module in the project Developed the Login Module and Reimbursement Module All modules developed with the framework design patterns and DAOs Hibernatefor persistence layer Spring Framework for Application layer Prototyped Flex based RFC using Flex consuming web services using BlazeDS Used Spring framework in enabling Controller Class access to Hibernate Designed and developed several Flex UI Screens and Custom Components using MXML and Action script Designed and developed user interface using Flex Components ViewStack Checkboxes Repeater Title Window Text Area and others Created components that have multiple views using States and also used Effectsand Transitions when a State is entered or exited Extensively used to data models to store the form data Worked on a proof of concept on Internationalization in flex Developed Action Script functions for event handling response handling and error handling Implemented Singleton Service Locator design patterns in Cairngorm MVC architecture to interact with backend Implemented JSON with Flex to feed Data grids into the web application Worked on development of Error Handling mechanism on the Flex side by catching the error code and message streamed from server and wrapping it in a custom Exception Object Used Blaze DS to connect flex application with backend J2EE and Web Services layer to pull out the data to Flex UI components Was responsible for deploying and testing webservices components Responsible to create Web Services to various web applications using Apache Axisesponsible to create WSDL WSDL2Java and Java2WSDL Stubs Extensively used SOAP in webservices to communicate with other applications Used SAX and DOM for parsing XML The Log4j package is used for the debugging Created JUnitand FlexUnittest case design logic and implemented throughout application
