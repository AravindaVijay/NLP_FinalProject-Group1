fits within a much larger application used by ETS to manage testing and test rating activities Technology used included JBoss Developer Studio 301 JBoss AS 60 application server Seam Java Server Faces RichFaces Subversion Maven HibernateJPA Spring DI Worked within a loose agile development environment Developed an application from scratch using the rapid application development features of JBoss Developer Studio Database schema already created by database administrators so used that as a basis for generating classes needed through utilities available for that purpose in Seam Developed the user interface with RichFaces facelets xhtml rather than jsp technology including frequent use of XML elements that handle Ajax interaction with the server Followed an example implementation that was adapted from the hotel reservation system example available in the Seam tutorials Used JPA as the data persistence layer of the application to communication with other layers and with the Oracle database JBoss Developer Studio uses the Hibernate implementation of JPA so JPA persistence objects act as wrappers around the underlying Hibernate API Used JUnit4 for continuous testing through plugin JBoss Developer Studio Worked with almost no direction from anyone else on the project so had to figure out most details for myself Acquainted myself sufficiently with Seam and RichFaces while doing the development without experience with either gaining a current high level of expertise in Seam and a good knowledge of RichFaces Solidified my understanding of JSF design features and implementation techniques and gained a full understanding of the interaction between JSF and Seam and where Seam improves upon the JSF design primarily in obviating the need for backing beans but also in adding phase listeners additional filter objects additional context objects to maintain different scopes of state depending how long maintenance of state from one phase of action to another was needed Java development as independent Java developer Below is a sample of Javabased development projects that I have done with my own direct clients before working on a contract basis on large

to 2009 Bidding on use of idle medical imaging equipment Prototype for an automated webaccessible service for patients who want to make bids on idle time available on imaging machines such as CAT computerized axial tomography scanners and MRI magnetic resonance imaging machines Equipment is expensive to acquire but relatively inexpensive to operate Diagnostic imaging facilities price is based usually on average cost assuming a certain level of utilization of the machinery during the year and with reference to the relevant CPT Current Procedure Terminology code translated into a monetary value by Medicare or by a private insurer or as a selfpay charge The average cost therefore is a function of the amortization period of the purchaseinstallation cost of the machine which is a big number in the million dollar plus range The machines however are often idle so pricing can be on an incremental cost basis which is quite low essentially the cost of a technician for a short period of time and the cost of electricity and and expendables to run the equipment In other words price able at say 100 rather than 1100 or so with fully loaded costs This application uses the Google GWT toolkit to create the JavaScript on the client side Web services use RESTful architecture JBoss RestEasy API Technology EJB 3 Spring Servlets MySQL Axis 14 for web services Wicket JSP Ajax among other

County Hospital a toprated hospital serving Chester County PA and the surrounding area The project developed is webaccessible application written in PHP Before creating and implementing the application a nurse anesthetists spent close to 15 hours per week scheduling anesthesiologist and nurse anesthetists for the practice The person used an ad hoc manual way of scheduling and communicating with her colleagues expending a significant amount of time that could be much better spend providing anesthesia services to the hospital Savings on the anesthetists time amounted to at least 60000 per year Significant savings in time to the personnel scheduled for work who now may check the schedule make changes and so at any time through the web interface Gave the project to

Educational Testing Service Ewing NJ September 2010 to February 2011 Web application development Project to develop a web application for payment of test raters that fits within a much larger application used by ETS to manage testing and test rating activities Technology used included JBoss Developer Studio 301 JBoss AS 60 application server Seam Java Server Faces RichFaces Subversion Maven HibernateJPA Spring DI Worked within a loose agile development environment Developed an application from scratch using the rapid application development features of JBoss Developer Studio Database schema already created by database administrators so used that as a basis for generating classes needed through utilities available for that purpose in Seam Developed the user interface with RichFaces facelets xhtml rather than jsp technology including frequent use of XML elements that handle Ajax interaction with the server Followed an example implementation that was adapted from the hotel reservation system example available in the Seam tutorials Used JPA as the data persistence layer of the application to communication with other layers and with the Oracle database JBoss Developer Studio uses the Hibernate implementation of JPA so JPA persistence objects act as wrappers around the underlying Hibernate API Used JUnit4 for continuous testing through plugin JBoss Developer Studio Worked with almost no direction from anyone else on the project so had to figure out most details for myself Acquainted myself sufficiently with Seam and RichFaces while doing the development without experience with either gaining a current high level of expertise in Seam and a good knowledge of RichFaces Solidified my understanding of JSF design features and implementation techniques and gained a full understanding of the interaction between JSF and Seam and where Seam improves upon the JSF design primarily in obviating the need for backing beans but also in adding phase listeners additional filter objects additional context objects to maintain different scopes of state depending how long maintenance of state from one phase of action to another was needed Java development as independent Java developer Below is a sample of Javabased development projects that I have done with my own direct clients before working on a contract basis on large enterprisetype projects In addition to Java development work I have done a range of business and technologyoriented consulting work primarily related to selection and implementation of electronic medical records EMR systems in ambulatory physicians practices environments I have also done a range of business type consulting Java developer American Field Service Intercultural Programs New York NY 2010 to 2010

for MVC Axis 14 for web services EJB 3 JPA for data persistence Spring for application context Java developer Project of Wendell Murray Associates Inc West Chester PA 2009 to 2009 Bidding on use of idle medical imaging equipment Prototype for an automated webaccessible service for patients who want to make bids on idle time available on imaging machines such as CAT computerized axial tomography scanners and MRI magnetic resonance imaging machines Equipment is expensive to acquire but relatively inexpensive to operate Diagnostic imaging facilities price is based usually on average cost assuming a certain level of utilization of the machinery during the year and with reference to the relevant CPT Current Procedure Terminology code translated into a monetary value by Medicare or by a private insurer or as a selfpay charge The average cost therefore is a function of the amortization period of the purchaseinstallation cost of the machine which is a big number in the million dollar plus range The machines however are often idle so pricing can be on an incremental cost basis which is quite low essentially the cost of a technician for a short period of time and the cost of electricity and and expendables to run the equipment In other words price able at say 100 rather than 1100 or so with fully loaded costs This application uses the Google GWT toolkit to create the JavaScript on the client side Web services use RESTful architecture JBoss RestEasy API Technology EJB 3 Spring Servlets MySQL Axis 14 for web services Wicket JSP Ajax among other technologies Logging Log4J Java developer Gateway Medical Associates Inc Exton PA 2008 to 2008 Health data warehousing Created a data warehouse using Talend ETL extract transform load application for a large multioffice multispecialty physicians practice that integrated data from a variety of sources demographic billing financial and patient clinical data This is part of several related projects including the current project listed above for creating a Health Information Exchange HIE in the eastern Pennsylvania Regional Extension Center area and specific to the needs of the physicians practice to centralize all of its data Experimented with Pentaho ETL but decided to use Talend for this project Technology used Java core APIs Talend Data Integration application Java developer Pioneer Urgent Care West Chester PA

Chester PA 2004 to 2004 Schedulingpersonnel management application Contracted with a 30person anesthesia practice that provides anesthesia services to the Chester County Hospital a toprated hospital serving Chester County PA and the surrounding area The project developed is webaccessible application written in PHP Before creating and implementing the application a nurse anesthetists spent close to 15 hours per week scheduling anesthesiologist and nurse anesthetists for the practice The person used an ad hoc manual way of scheduling and communicating with her colleagues expending a significant amount of time that could be much better spend providing anesthesia services to the hospital Savings on the anesthetists time amounted to at least 60000 per year Significant savings in time to the personnel scheduled for work who now may check the schedule make changes and so at any time through the web interface Gave the project to Intratechs a software developer in West Chester PA

medical records system consulting Business advisory Tax work Active in the USA and in Italy Java developer Windsor Mill MD July 2018 to July 2019 Applications to capture report on remediate possible security violations into SSA systems Public trust security clearance Completed one year contract to make enhancements to two of the SSAs socalled cybersecurity applications Full refactoring of the code in one application to increase speed of processing as well as to make what was almost undecipherable code easy to read follow and maintain Due to the inflexibility of the development process followed by the SSA unable to do the same refactoring for the second application in the time available The second application also webbrowseraccessed handles the complicated SSA process of granting resource access to software developers to all resources on the mainframe computing system Goal of one application simple process resource access logs produced by the SSAs mainframe computer then parse analyze write the data to a SQL DB2 RDMS database through a batch application Once the relevant data are available in the SQL database a web interface application permits security officers for the many organizational units of the SSA to view the data and to take any appropriate actions Technology used WebSphere 85 application server Struts 2 internally developed JSP tags JSTL JSP JavaScript CSS custom JavaScript library JQuery myBatis for data store interaction for one application JDBC for the other application Batch processing uses bash scripts run in a UNIX environment on the mainframe computer then moved to a Linux computing environment so the batch scripts required some revision Required some knowledge of IBM mainframe design and Job Control Language scripts as well as scripting

the Amazon cloud for database storage I use PostgreSQL running on a local network PatientOS is a distributed system that uses JBoss as application server Mirth Hibernate and JDBC for database access a webbased patient portal fat Swing interface and thin browser interface client access to the server and connectors for exchanging XML and HL7 with external systems Mirth is an interface engine which can handle a variety of messaging protocols including HL7 and other types of messages The system was designed using concepts from OpenEHR which is a specification for healthcare information systems that includes a reference model domain classes a service model service classes and an archetype model archetypes are created to limit the domain classes for specific purposes The Java architecture contains 1 data access layer 2 business logic layer that contains classes for business rules domain objects and service classes and 3 presentation layer that uses the service facade and MVC design patterns Among physicians practices that I have worked with regarding EMR systems is Gateway Medical Associates Inc which has more than 15 primary care and specialty offices in Chester County PA PatientOS also evaluated at several other multioffice specialty practices in Chester County Gateway is on the forefront of physician practices which have implemented and used EMR technologies Very

web service annotations to interact with clients and services on either side of the web application ATG on the client side a custom ERP now in use and SAP the replacement ERP on the service side Web service development interacting through the SAP JCO API to the SAP ERP backend application so custom programming using the JCO API IDE used standard Eclipse with standard plugins for JBoss as application service Maven pomxml files for builds JRebel for incremental builds CVS plugin for interacting with the remote CVS respository Made many changes to existing application to refactor classes and class relationships which needed simplification or improvement Superb and effective collaboration with another contract developer working on the same application and with an excellent project manager from the client company who helped us obtain attention from other personnel and other resources which we needed Mostly left to myself and my collaborating developer to figure out what to do and how to go about it with very little input or direction from the person supervising ecommerce development activities Data persistence to existing development and quality assurance Oracle databases including frequent calling of procedures with the Oracle database Development of new tables within given Oracle databases to provide database persistence for new functionality added to the application Minor additionschanges to a Spring ApplicationContext object used to tie components together Additionschanges to the datasource xml document in JBoss to accommodate new data source connections within a connection pool Java developer Educational Testing Service Ewing NJ September 2010 to February 2011 Web application development Project to develop a web application for payment of test raters that fits within a much larger application used by ETS to manage testing and test rating activities Technology used included JBoss Developer Studio 301 JBoss AS 60 application server Seam Java Server Faces RichFaces Subversion Maven HibernateJPA Spring DI Worked within a loose agile development environment Developed an application from scratch using the rapid application development features of JBoss Developer Studio Database schema already created by database administrators so used that as a basis for generating classes needed through utilities available for that purpose in Seam Developed the user interface with RichFaces facelets xhtml rather than jsp technology including frequent use of XML elements that handle Ajax interaction with the server Followed an example implementation that was adapted from the hotel reservation system example available in the Seam tutorials Used JPA as the data persistence layer of the application to communication with other layers and with the Oracle database JBoss Developer Studio uses the Hibernate implementation of JPA so JPA persistence objects act as wrappers around the underlying Hibernate API Used JUnit4 for continuous testing through plugin JBoss Developer Studio Worked with almost no direction from anyone else on the project so had to figure out most details for myself Acquainted myself sufficiently with Seam and RichFaces while doing the development without experience with either gaining a current high level of expertise in Seam and a good knowledge of RichFaces Solidified my understanding of JSF design features and implementation techniques and gained a full understanding of the interaction between JSF and Seam and where Seam improves upon the JSF design primarily in obviating the need for backing beans but also in adding phase listeners additional filter objects additional context objects to maintain different scopes of state depending how long maintenance of state from one phase of action to another was needed Java development as independent Java developer Below is a sample of Javabased development projects that I have done with my own direct clients before working on a contract basis on large enterprisetype projects In addition to Java development work I have done a range of business and technologyoriented consulting work primarily related to selection and implementation of electronic medical records EMR systems in ambulatory physicians practices environments I have also done a range of business type consulting Java developer American Field Service Intercultural Programs New York

web tier along with Wicket for MVC Axis 14 for web services EJB 3 JPA for data persistence Spring for application context Java developer Project of Wendell Murray Associates Inc West Chester PA 2009 to 2009 Bidding on use of idle medical imaging equipment Prototype for an automated webaccessible service for patients who want to make bids on idle time available on imaging machines such as CAT computerized axial tomography scanners and MRI magnetic resonance imaging machines Equipment is expensive to acquire but relatively inexpensive to operate Diagnostic imaging facilities price is based usually on average cost assuming a certain level of utilization of the machinery during the year and with reference to the relevant CPT Current Procedure Terminology code translated into a monetary value by Medicare or by a private insurer or as a selfpay charge The average cost therefore is a function of the amortization period of the purchaseinstallation cost of the machine which is a big number in the million dollar plus range The machines however are often idle so pricing can be on an incremental cost basis which is quite low essentially the cost of a technician for a short period of time and the cost of electricity and and expendables to run the equipment In other words price able at say 100 rather than 1100 or so with fully loaded costs This application uses the Google GWT toolkit to create the JavaScript on the client side Web services use RESTful architecture JBoss RestEasy API Technology EJB 3 Spring Servlets MySQL Axis 14 for web services Wicket JSP Ajax among other technologies Logging Log4J Java developer Gateway Medical Associates Inc Exton PA 2008 to 2008 Health data warehousing Created a data warehouse using Talend ETL extract transform load application for a large multioffice multispecialty physicians practice that integrated data from a variety of sources demographic billing financial and patient clinical data This is part of several related projects including the current project listed above for creating a Health Information Exchange HIE in the eastern Pennsylvania Regional Extension Center area and specific to the needs of the physicians practice to centralize all of its data Experimented with Pentaho ETL but decided to use Talend for this project Technology used Java core APIs Talend Data Integration application Java developer

application written in PHP Before creating and implementing the application a nurse anesthetists spent close to 15 hours per week scheduling anesthesiologist and nurse anesthetists for the practice The person used an ad hoc manual way of scheduling and communicating with her colleagues expending a significant amount of time that could be much better spend providing anesthesia services to the hospital Savings on the anesthetists time amounted to at least 60000 per year Significant savings in time to the personnel scheduled for work who now may check the schedule make changes and so at any time through the web interface Gave the project to Intratechs a software developer in West Chester PA to refactor and create the final PHP version Software development prior to 2002 Programming on
