HP Quality Centre and Service Desk Electrical and Computer Engineering Projects Speech recognition and active noise cancellation Jan 2014 May 2014 University of Rochester Rochester NY Implemented an adaptive algorithm which used the two microphones of a cellular phone to analyze speech signal and the unwanted background noise The algorithm then adaptively real time adjusts the filter coefficients to reduceremove the noise signal The convergence time of the algorithm varied depending upon the randomness of the background noise and its periodicity Some other practical applications of these type of algorithms include 1 Mobile phones 2VoIP teleconferencing systems 3 Speech recognition 4 Hearing aids 5Air to Ground communication between ATC and Pilot URL

Rochester NY Project on optimization of RF power of wireless transreceivers for enhanced battery life under Dr Wendi Heinzelman Project involved monitoring the received power at the radio receiver for different separation distances and maintaining it adaptively as a function of distance over a certain threshold necessary for an optimum level of SNR for uninterrupted call and consequently average battery backup Decompression and deblocking of compressed JPEG images Aug 2008 Dec 2008 Tezpur Central University Assam India Most of the applications running on cellphones perform compression of images before sending them via email or other chat applications Our objective was to design and implement an efficient deblocking algorithm which can perform efficient reconstruction of these compressed images at the receiver end via interpolation Platform used MATLAB Electrical and Computer Engineering Awards and Scholarships Recipient of tuition scholarship at graduate level and 2 merit
