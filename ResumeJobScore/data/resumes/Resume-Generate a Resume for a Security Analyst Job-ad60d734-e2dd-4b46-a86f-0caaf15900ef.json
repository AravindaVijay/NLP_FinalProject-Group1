database tables based on the analysis of the business domain Created web services and desktop applications to access and display data needed by support teams using HTML5 JavaScript jQuery CSS3 SaaS and AJAX Used Spring Core Annotations for Dependency Injection Spring DI and Spring MVC for REST API s and Spring Boot for microservices Designed and generated reports using Jasper Followed Test Driven Development TDD Scrum concepts of the Agile Methodology to produce high Quality Software Implemented Spring MVC Framework Integration of userfacing elements developed by frontend developers with serverside logic Created an XML configuration file for Hibernate Database connectivity Wrote services to store and retrieve user data from the Oracle SQL DB for the application on devices Used Maven as the build tool Created connections to database using Hibernate Session Factory using Hibernate APIs to retrieve and store data to the database with Hibernate transaction control Performed Some Manual testing as well Configured Hibernate objects as Spring Beans in the Spring Configuration File Documented all stages of the project generated documentation Worked parallel over releases to clean up code and make performance improvements to the application Worked with other senior and junior Java developers Interacted with users and other project team members on daily basis Environment
