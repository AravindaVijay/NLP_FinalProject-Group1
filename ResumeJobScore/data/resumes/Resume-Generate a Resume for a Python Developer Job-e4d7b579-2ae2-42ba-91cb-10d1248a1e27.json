securities wholesale products which are also in python Detailed analysis understanding of the user stories The business requirements are charted out in user stories that are discussed understood from BAs as part of sprint kick off These requirements bring about the implementation of financial instrument valuation modeling the market risks Numerous risk exposure calculations like CEM REPO SACCR FAILS are carried out via these enhancements Perform impact analysis high level design facilitating BAs to arrive at requirements for other related application areas Codedevelop business logic as per the client coding guidelines Have used IDLE Pycharm Shell environments for the development purposes Develop using the OO or functional programming paradigms Normal classes functions are extensively used Develop unit testing module for each and every module created using the unitTesting framework of python Make sure that the coverage is client recommended 80 Familiar with the thread module of Python Have used multi threading queues in functions when the data is in large and processing time is in scarce Build Functional APIs for the process improvement to avoid abends to meet recommendations from test QA teams and to make ease of our daily activities Perform code reviews test coverage reviews Release management Production support proper documentation of migration at each

areas Served as one point contact for migration to Python and answered SME questions 2 years of experience in Analysis Design Development Management implementation of standalone Python projects Extensively developed many modules of the Billing Application in Python Calculating monthly premiums processing remits are all migrated to Python Proficient with myPQI module This is a package to sendreceive messages through pipes and it works similar to RabbitMQ Completely Developed a Payload calculator project using Python to automatically determine the load I was involved from initial understanding of business requirements until roll out The commonality of the data between the employee the dependents allowed the use of OO concepts All the business reports were generated in Python scripts and deployed in PROD both planned Adhoc Math Collections Sys Requests are some of the modules used extensively Wrote Python scripts to parse the XML documents and save them in the shares The parsed data is used to analyze the customer data its repeatability Good Understanding Practice on SAX parsing Have exposure to DOM parsing familiar with several DOM methods Wrote numerous Python scripts to extract the data from text Excel csv files as part of Integration Project team activities Written Automation tools in Python to ease out daily application activities The development time of few standard business reports were cut down when designed with Python Walkthrough Operations team for the Python scripts to be executed in PROD The order of execution time are clearly communicated as a crosstraining Main liaison between the different product teams and our team The data representations in their respective application when changed to python are enumerated explained aiding the design of the system Environment Python Pycharm Windows XML WebSphere MQ Scripting text Team Lead Cognizant Technology Solutions Coimbatore Tamil Nadu March 2011 to February 2015 MetLife MetLife the largest
