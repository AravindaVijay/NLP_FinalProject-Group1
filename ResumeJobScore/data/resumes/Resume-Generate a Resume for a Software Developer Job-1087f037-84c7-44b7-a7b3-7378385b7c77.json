compared with peers I also actively participated and contributed in the process migrating a PaaS environment from a monolith application to microservices architecture I developed backend components for Template API servicesSpring boot and Message Trigger ServicesNodejs and initiated template migration project to migrate legacy data to adapt to the new services Through playing roles in developing those projects I am confident that my skills can smoothly fit in roles requiring modern development methodologies and technologies Besides the experience working with Java related technology I also have experience with C PHP Javascript Python Swift SQL Im passionate about every new emerging things in our field and I know all technologies would become outdated in the future the only thing left is
