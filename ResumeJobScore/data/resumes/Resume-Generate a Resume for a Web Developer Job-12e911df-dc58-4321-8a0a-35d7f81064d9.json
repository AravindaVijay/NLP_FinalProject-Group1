Developer Bidpath And SAM Auction Software San Francisco CA May 2016 to Present Zend Framework Composer Ratchet PhpUnit Webpack ES6 Nodejs Websockets GoLang Java Developed customer oriented realtime bidding php server Solved performance bottleneck of 1000 websocket simultaneous connections which gives us ability to not rewrite the main code and significantly increase simultaneous connections more than 100000 Continuously improved system performance optimized big mysql queries troubleshooted database transaction issues wrote report generator in GoLang which decreased report creation from 60 seconds to 100 milliseconds Applied generators and coroutings to improve performance and memory footprint lazy load for data Introduced composer package manager to organize php dependencies It gives us the ability to maintain dependencies up to date by one command We started using standard autoloader and follow PSR standards of coding Developed REST architecture based web services to facilitate communication between client and servers Standardize json response from them It gives standard way of communication and easier to maintain with less errors Eg created a service to handle image carousel Before we sent the whole html and now just data in json Created a service to handle auction watch list lots Developed SOAP based service to provide API for users to control their auction and lots Was initiator of the idea to refactor js code to ES6 and extract js from php I introduced webpack to the team and led a subteam of 3 developers I wrote tickets for them in Jira and mentored them managed features and bug backlog reviewed code and consulting Created a future architecture of all js code Organized legacy JS code with webpack nodejs karma ES6 Wrote documentations for other developers on how to use webpack and new js coding 3 articles Helped develop and set coding style standards in js and php Introduced the team to unit testing and established it as a part of standard development process Wrote more than 500 unit tests 100 integration tests Wrote a bot based on Selenium Java that act as a user I used it to start several bots to test an auction and catch a floating

successful project accomplishments Coached and trained teammates and junior developers coordinated an admin team Designed architecture Developed and wrote external and internal design specifications I created custom Browser automation based on webkit component of Qt frameworkc python for autopublication ads of clients This feature brought 60 of new clients to the company Created chat on NodeJs websockets Wrote a prototype on Java to recognize digits from images to collect data which brought 80 of company content Then improved it using Tesseract OCR Designed framework to develop scrappers The framework gave the ability to hire junior developers and gave them a separate task Which eliminated the need to show them the project code It saved company money increased development speed and kept quality of the main code intact Analyzed monitored reviewed and improved application performance Offered to use SOA to solve the increasing load Improved performance by extracting Search service based on ElasticSearch I offered to use replication and use separate read and write database servers It increased stability of the service and performance Created API for mobile devices It was a new feature that connected a browser extension with an app on users phone This feature helped dial a phone number for our user Created service to upload images with post process on RabbitMQ workers I implemented the process to save images in divided folder based on hash from an image eg imagesgh4wdfgh4wdfpng It increased performance of saving images on HDD All image hashes were saved in db It gave the ability to upload same images instantly and eliminating the need to keep copies This approach helped us to use less servers and made user experience much better Freelancer MOSCOW RU June 2011 to

Developer Bidpath And SAM Auction Software San Francisco CA May 2016 to Present Zend Framework Composer Ratchet PhpUnit Webpack ES6 Nodejs Websockets GoLang Java Developed customer oriented realtime bidding php server Solved performance bottleneck of 1000 websocket simultaneous connections which gives us ability to not rewrite the main code and significantly increase simultaneous connections more than 100000 Continuously improved system performance optimized big mysql queries troubleshooted database transaction issues wrote report generator in GoLang which decreased report creation from 60 seconds to 100 milliseconds Applied generators and coroutings to improve performance and memory footprint lazy load for data Introduced composer package manager to organize php dependencies It gives us the ability to maintain dependencies up to date by one command We started using standard autoloader and follow PSR standards of coding Developed REST architecture based web services to facilitate communication between client and servers Standardize json response from them It gives standard way of communication and easier to maintain with less errors Eg created a service to handle image carousel Before we sent the whole html and now just data in json Created a service to handle auction watch list lots Developed SOAP based service to provide API for users to control their auction and lots Was initiator of the idea to refactor js code to ES6 and extract js from php I introduced webpack to the team and led a subteam of 3 developers I wrote tickets for them in Jira and mentored them managed features and bug backlog reviewed code and consulting Created a future architecture of all js code Organized legacy JS code with webpack nodejs karma ES6 Wrote documentations for other developers on how to use webpack and new js coding 3 articles Helped develop and set coding style standards in js and php Introduced the team to unit testing and established it as a part of standard development process Wrote more than 500 unit tests 100 integration tests Wrote a bot based on Selenium Java that act as a user I used it to start several bots to test an auction and catch a floating bug in the timer race condition FullStack Developer UJen LLC St Louis MO June 2017 to April 2018 Azure Cloud NET Core 2EF Core MSSQL bootstrap 4 webpack es6 threejs Created CRM Easy Bend site for

successful project accomplishments Coached and trained teammates and junior developers coordinated an admin team Designed architecture Developed and wrote external and internal design specifications I created custom Browser automation based on webkit component of Qt frameworkc python for autopublication ads of clients This feature brought 60 of new clients to the company Created chat on NodeJs websockets Wrote a prototype on Java to recognize digits from images to collect data which brought 80 of company content Then improved it using Tesseract OCR Designed framework to develop scrappers The framework gave the ability to hire junior developers and gave them a separate task Which eliminated the need to show them the project code It saved company money increased development speed and kept quality of the main code intact Analyzed monitored reviewed and improved application performance Offered to use SOA to solve the increasing load Improved performance by extracting Search service based on ElasticSearch I offered to use replication and use separate read and write database servers It increased stability of the service and performance Created API for mobile devices It was a new feature that connected a browser extension with an app on users phone This feature helped dial a phone number for our user Created service to upload images with post process on RabbitMQ workers I implemented the process to save images in divided folder based on hash from an image eg imagesgh4wdfgh4wdfpng It increased performance of saving images on HDD All image hashes were saved in db It gave the ability to upload same images instantly and eliminating the need to keep copies This approach helped us to use less servers and made user experience much better Freelancer MOSCOW RU June 2011 to
