small team environment mostly maintaining the administrative portion of the existing AMC Links sites back end code While there I created a HTML templating class to aid in the transitioning of the code to a more MVC design pattern as well as a helper class to created commonly used elements such data driven select options and radio sets Many of the new projects involved creating complex queries to retrieve data and UI development for the clients and output reports Some of the work I did involved improving and replacing inefficient code examples 1 One application that uploaded a csv file and compared values against the database took 23 minutes to run and render on the browser after recoding I improved the time to 19 seconds 2 An application that found the average appraisal turnaround times for a specific area and if none found kept widening it to county state and had admin side default that could be set This original application was written with over 20 queries and very slow I was able to replace this with 2 queries and about a quarter of the lines of code I developed a small recursive method that did address abbreviation permutations and compared addresses existing in the database to find possible duplicates that were input incorrectly In addition to the backend coding I also developed user interfaces for the administrative pages As well as some graphic sprites In

links to contained documents that could be infinitely tiered and the documents could be placed in multiple topics that only displayed if the user had the correct credentials Because these documents needed to be extra secure the files themselves were located outside the public root and named with a salted hash The links to these files were also encrypted with a different hash that was salted
