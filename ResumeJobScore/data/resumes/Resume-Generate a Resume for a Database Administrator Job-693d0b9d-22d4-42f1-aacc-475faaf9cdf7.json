loading of web pages using AJAX calls with server pages Developed frontend systems Responsive Design with HTML CSS JavaScript HTML5 CSS3 and frameworks jQuery Angular JS JSON and Bootstrap Used Hibernate for object relational mapping and query databases using HQL and SQL Micro services used to flexible to develop test build and independently deployable software systems such as ADE SCV and OPRA distributed applications Each team can develop deploy and scale their services independently of all the other teams Experience on deploying each service independently of other services easier to deploy new versions of services frequently in Micro service no impact to other modules while deployinginstance refresh Used Rational Application Developer RAD as the Integrated Development Environment for developing debugging the application build run create JARs WAR files and setup the WebSphere Application Server Used clear case version control to maintain the different version of the project files and merge to release branch and compare the files Used SSO SAML token creation and authenticate to the external system from ADE application Involved in the development of dynamic loading of web pages using AJAX calls with server pages Fixing Bugs Troubleshooting Change Requests Supportandclose the defects coordinating with testing team Followed agile methodology and VChain modal for project development and delivery of application including Test Driven Development Experience in production support and maintenance to troubleshoot production issues or tickets raised by businesscustomers
