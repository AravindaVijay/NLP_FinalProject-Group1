synchronous calling Evicore Bluffton SC 2015 to 2017 Web Applications Developer Evicore 2015 to 2016 Design and create multiple web application for Evicores core business These applications were designed with express intent of streamlining the businesss call center and customer application management Design and develop Radcare Administration web application using MVC5 This application is used for administration of Insurance Carriers such as BCBS HIGHMARK Aetna etc and gives them the ability to associate facilities and providers with Radiation Therapy treatment programs to the implementation This allows for correct assignment of customers with approved insurance claims to get to the correct facilities and providers in their area covered by their medical insurance Design and developed PI Rollover Service This service was designed with the express intent of reducing the amount of cases waiting from approval The approval process can be costly to the business as it sometimes requires doctors or nurses to review the cases This service is set up to run nightly and retrieve pending cases that have yet to be approved It then runs each case through a strict and complex vetting process that ultimately uses predictive intelligence data to approve pending medical cases This application reduced the need for the business to hire 10 or more nurses and greatly reduced the amount of backlogged cases Assist with a large business effort to convert from ICD9 to ICD10 medical codes The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision ICD10 This effort on my part largely consisted of creating a web application that would connect to a web service and pull the correct ICD10 codes from the database for a specific medicalhealth problem This application is used daily by the over 1000 call center operators in direct connection with a customer Due to the large call volume and continuous utilization this created significant overhead on the servers A lot of work and time was put it on the database and web services to optimize the return result speed Web Developer DBA 2014 to 2015 Designed and developed Political Action Committee UI
