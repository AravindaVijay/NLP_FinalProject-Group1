highlysuccessful global SaaS startup that later became Verizon Connect Work Experience Director of Software Engineering Transtar Industries Walton Hills OH 2018 to Present Led a lean agile team of API and Web developers Upgraded production SQL Server to the 2017 edition running on a SANless failover cluster Utilized Distributed Availability Groups to move databases to another Data Center with little to no downtime Implemented new SQL Server licensing model to best utilize ActivePassive clusters Modeled data and created stored procedures for a brand new pointofsale platform Implemented tokenbased security and password validation using hash keys generated via SHA2 512 bit algorithm Imported legacy software users along with their hashed security settings for seamless platform migration Leveraged hierarchy types to embed taxonomy of products and their fitment into searchable binary values Schemaseparated different functional entities for both ease of access and security
