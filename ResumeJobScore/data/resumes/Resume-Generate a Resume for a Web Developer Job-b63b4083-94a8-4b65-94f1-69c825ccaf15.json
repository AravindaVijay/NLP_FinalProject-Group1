is both Python 36 and 27 compatible It used a number of conversion capabilities based on the Email Beautiful Soup and other data conversion systems The original Perl used Regex extensively and also lacked a menudriven method to identify types of email I wrote special Regex functions that returned multiple values so as to modularize and I used a Dict with else to create a proper menu Output json

2018 Python Design and implement Email Alert processing system by converting existing Perl program to Python Email program is both Python 36 and 27 compatible It used a number of conversion capabilities based on the Email Beautiful Soup and other data conversion systems The original Perl used Regex extensively and also lacked a menudriven method to identify types of email I wrote special Regex functions that returned multiple values so as to modularize and I used a Dict with else to create a proper menu Output json to MongoDB Testing using nose pytest Document the conversion in detail on Git using Sphinx Maintain and enhance the original Perl 5 system on Debian In addition to converting the program I also learned the Perl language and maintained the program Environment Debian Linux

is both Python 36 and 27 compatible It used a number of conversion capabilities based on the Email Beautiful Soup and other data conversion systems The original Perl used Regex extensively and also lacked a menudriven method to identify types of email I wrote special Regex functions that returned multiple values so as to modularize and I used a Dict with else to create a proper menu Output json
