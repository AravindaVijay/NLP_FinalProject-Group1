application classes as Spring Beans using Spring IOCDependency Injection Developed various java objects POJO as part of persistence classes for ORM Worked on JavaScript JQuery and Servlets to generate dynamic web pages and web contents Used MVC design pattern for designing application JSP and CSS3 as the view component Modified log4j for logging and debugging Used AngularJS to create single page applications and pagination Experience in working with the Columnar NoSQL Database like HBase Cassandra to manage extremely large data sets Development and Debugging was done using Eclipse IDE Prepared Unit test cases using JUnit and integration testing Application was deployed using JBoss and used SQL Server as database server Used Selenium test tool for web application testing Implemented REST Full based Webservices Implementation of the Business logic layer for Mongo DB Services Used Jenkins build tool for Continuous Integration Worked in developing the UI in HTML CSS JavaScript Also converted the UI code to JSP tags Implemented cache algorithms to decrease the overall execution time Building application and deployment in servers as per request from the QA team using Maven Used Maven for version control and configuration management and changed multiple VCS for example CVS and SVN for respective advantage Used JUnit for testing the application modules and Log4Jfor logging Done unit testing using JUnit Developed test scripts in Groovy to report application Wrote the GroovyGrails plugin to address security of Rich Text in Grails application Designed and implemented a reporting system using Groovy Monitoring team development activities followup on the tasks and provide assistance Working with development teams to troubleshoot development environment production environment and performance tune and optimize code Providing onsite and oncall support for production and integration environments Developed and Deployed the same application in Android and deployed it in local play store Also tested the application on Android Platform using Android adb commands Environment J2EE Java 7 Servlets XML JDBC Hibernate Struts 20 Maven JavaScript JSP 20 CSS3 Angularjs

determined on the basis of costs expected to be incurred This payment method is an alternative to a pure feeforservice arrangement ECap Enterprise Capitation solution to support provider reimbursement for HMO based commercial business within UnitedHealth Group From the UnixJ2EE perspective the ECap project is comprised of two parts namely the Online Application and the ThinClient Application Responsibilities Online use JSP to control activity and the ThinClient uses UNIX shell scripts to control activity Developed UI for the Development of UI using JSP model classes which handle the data from JSP and perform the business logic controller classes which routes the request to appropriate action classes to handle the request Perform validation using JavaScript and use AJAX to create more interactive web pages Have 2 scripts for each environment one for internal reports and one for the adjustments email Adjustment email script passes an argument to the performing class RptClient Developed JMS components to send messages from one application to other application internally The UNIX shell scripts are in turn initiated by a scheduler AutoSys which runs the internal reports three times a day and the adjustment email once a day Developed various test cases and performance unit testing Involved in enhancements coding Prepare UTP Peer review and code review docs Environment
