Design Coding Unit Testing and System Integration Testing Work Experience Thingworx and Java Developer Sealed Air Saint Petersburg FL January 2015 to August 2015 Project CookBook The objective of this project is to support debug troubleshooting process for repair devices in IQOR after Market Services As part of this project to be repaired devices are scanned and retrieved information related to the device using External interface The device is troubleshooting by connecting with real time devices and reduces decision making process required from debugger This project succeeded in attaining reduced skill set and time required for ramp up of the debuggers as the complete trouble shooting process is automated and requires minimal user interaction Once the troubleshooting process is done the fault analysis is performed identifies the defect in the device and decides whether the faulty piece is to be repaired or replaced In case of part replacement a request is placed dynamically for all the parts that are to be replaced The device is allowed to send to other WorkCentre for Repair Responsibilities Involved in Analysis of Requirements and defining the System Requirement Specifications Used Rational Rose for providing the UML design for the given modules and applied OOAD principles in designing the applications Understanding and analyzing the existing CookBook

Design Coding Unit Testing and System Integration Testing Work Experience Thingworx and Java Developer Sealed Air Saint Petersburg FL January 2015 to August 2015 Project CookBook The objective of this project is to support debug troubleshooting process for repair devices in IQOR after Market Services As part of this project to be repaired devices are scanned and retrieved information related to the device using External interface The device is troubleshooting by connecting with real time devices and reduces decision making process required from debugger This project succeeded in attaining reduced skill set and time required for ramp up of the debuggers as the complete trouble shooting process is automated and requires minimal user interaction Once the troubleshooting process is done the fault analysis is performed identifies the defect in the device and decides whether the faulty piece is to be repaired or replaced In case of part replacement a request is placed dynamically for all the parts that are to be replaced The device is allowed to send to other WorkCentre for Repair Responsibilities Involved in Analysis of Requirements and defining the System Requirement Specifications Used Rational Rose for providing the UML design for the given modules and applied OOAD principles in designing the applications Understanding and analyzing the existing CookBook
