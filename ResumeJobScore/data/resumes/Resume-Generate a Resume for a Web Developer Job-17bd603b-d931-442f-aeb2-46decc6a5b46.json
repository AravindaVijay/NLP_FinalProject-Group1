management IMEI Allocation management ensures that the range of available IMEI numbers which is a finite resource is carefully managed to ensure optimum use of the available range The GSMA defines the manner in which IMEIs are allocated and applications are accepted from handset manufacturers Color list management describes the sharing of information related to IMEI records The IMEI database is the central repository that contains information on number ranges and attributes of approved mobile equipment whitelist IMEIs of equipment to be barred service blacklist The greylist is also maintained
