design patterns like MVC DAO Proxy Singleton Builder Factory Involved in writing testcases using Junit debugging Implementation and deployment activities Implemented standard logging using Log4j to help tracking info dev warn and error Supported fixing defects detected from quality center in the regression session Involved in test driven development TDD model using JUnit and Mockito Designed integrated test cases for developing stories and executed part of these test cases Supported Testing team during System and Integration Test phases in both sprint and regression session Involved in stories design and review meeting gave feedback and evaluate them Used Agile Methodology for Java development Environment Java J2EE Jersey Webservices Nodejs Servlets RESTFUL web Services SQL PLSQL
