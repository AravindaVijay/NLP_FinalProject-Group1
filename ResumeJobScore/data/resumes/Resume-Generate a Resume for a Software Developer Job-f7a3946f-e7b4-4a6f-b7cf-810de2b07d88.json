Windows Responsibilities Involved in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle SDLC including analysis design development and testing of the project Used spring framework applications like Spring Core Spring AOP Spring MVC Spring Batch Spring Security and Spring Boot and did integration to Micro services into existing system architecture Used Spring AOP for solving crosscutting concerns like keeping logged data and transactions details etc Used Spring Boot to create standalone spring applications Used Spring MVC framework for implementing ModelView Controller MVC architecture at the Web tier level to isolate each layer of the application so that complexity of integration will be reduced and maintenance will be very easy Implemented Spring Boot services in combination with Angular as front end to form a Micro Service Oriented application Used Spring ORM Hibernate Template as the ORM tool to communicate with the database Used ObjectRelational mapping tool Hibernate and JPA to achieve object to database table persistency Developed Hibernate POJO Classes Hibernate Configuration file and Hibernate Mapping files Angular JS was used to parse the JSON file using the REST Web services Used multithreading in programming to improve overall performance using Singleton design pattern in Hibernate Utility class Created set of classes using DAO pattern to decouple the business logic and data Implemented SOA to develop REST Based Web services using Apache Tomcat Developed rich and complex Responsive Web User Interface using HTML5XHTML JavaScript CSS3 XML JavaScript JQuery AngularJS NodeJS and Bootstrap Used HTML5 JQuery Angularjs and CSS3 to design the front end components Implemented and used Rest Web Services with the help of JAXRS to get updates from the third parties Used JMS for the asynchronous exchange of critical business data and events among J2EE components and legacy system Involved in creating and extracting data from database using SQL Queries PLSQL Stored procedures triggers and packages on Oracle database Wrote EJBStateless session to communicate with Controller and Service layer ie make the EJB calls from Backing Beans Implemented Log4J for Logging Errors debugging and tracking using loggers appenders components Used AJAX to call the REST API methods and connect to the backend Restful web services have been used to retrieve and update the data using this AJAX Monitored team members to follow standards guide lines and use new tools Full Stack Developer LPL Financial San Diego CA November 2017 to July 2018 Environment JavaJ2EE

phases of the project with major emphasis on Development of the modules like Activations Customer Service Involved in component development using J2EE principles and used design patterns such as Singleton Factory and Data Access Object DAO in the implementation of the application Used Spring MVC and Dependency Injection for handling presentation and business logic To maintain loose coupling between layers published the business layer as services and injected necessary dependent components using Spring IOC and published cross cutting concerns like Logging User Interface exceptions Transactions using Spring AOP Developed Action Classes Action Form Classes created JSPs using Struts tag libraries and configured in Struts configxml Webxml files Integrated Spring DAO for data access using Hibernate Implemented persistence framework using Hibernate and Handled Transaction Management using the provided data source Extensively used JSON to parse the data from server side to satisfy the business requirement Involved in UI level coding using JSP JavaScript JQuery Angularjs and JSTL Responsible for designing Hibernate mapping files based on business logic and Object relationships Integrated Spring and Hibernate together and worked on developing backend components and services using Hibernate and spring Established Database Connectivity using JDBC Hibernate OR mapping with Spring ORM for Oracle Used Multithreading in programming to improve overall performance using Singleton design pattern in Hibernate Utility class Developed Single page application with using AngularJS with MVC Frame Work Created reusable components and services to consume REST APIs using componentbased architecture provided by Angularjs Designed and developed UI using HTML5 CSS Bootstrap CSS JQuery JSON and AJAX Used WSDL and SOAP protocol for Web Services implementation Compiled and built the application using ANT scripts and deployed the application Developed and Deployed EJBs and other Components in the JBoss Application Server Configured and created application log files using Log4J Created tables triggers PLSQL Stored Procedures SQL queries Joins constraints and views for Oracle

from scratch Involved in designing developing and testing of J2EE components like Java Beans Java XML Collection Framework JSP Servlets JMS JDBC and deployments in IBM WebSphere Server Effectively developed Action classes Action forms JSP JSF and other configuration files like strutsconfigxml webxml Used Eclipse as Java IDE tool for creating various J2EE artifacts like Servlets JSPs and XML Involved in developing Rules to send messages to customs using Rule Processor using JRules Used SpringMVC framework to enable the interactions between JSPView layer and implemented different design patterns with J2EE and JSON technology Developed web services technology JAXB to convert XML into java objects Developed the warear file using Maven script and deployed into WebSphere Application Server Developed Exception handling code to recover from DB specific Application specific Business and Nonbusiness logic specific exceptions Worked on JUnit test cases to test all possible business scenarios with the knowledge of Test First Methodology and Test Driven Development Performed backend testing on Oracle and SQL Server databases by writing SQL queries to make sure the contents
