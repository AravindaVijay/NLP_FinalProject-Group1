database Model APIs and Views utilizing Python to build an interactive webbased application Involved in building database Model APIs and Views utilizing Python to build an interactive webbased solution Developed a fully automated continuous integration system using Git Jenkins MySQL and custom tools developed in Python and Bash Designed and managed API system deployment using fast http server and Amazon AWS architectureand also developed frontend and backend modules using Python on Django including Tasty Pie Web Framework using Git Collect data that introspects the performance of query and update operations on a MongoDB instance and recorded the online users data using Python Django forms and implemented test case using Pytest Developed Ruby Python scripts to monitor health of Mongo databases and perform adhoc backups using Mongo dump and Mongo restore Worked in DevOps group running Jenkins in a Docker container with EC2 slaves in Amazon AWS cloud configuration Also gained familiarity with supporting technologies like kubernetes and Mesos Used regular expression for faster search results in combination with Angular2 builtin and custom pipes Develop consumerbased features and applications using Python Django HTML Behaviour Driven Development BDD and pairbased programming Used Test driven approach for developing the application and Implemented the unit tests using Python Unit test framework and Development of Isomorphic ReactJS and Redux driven API client applications Developed backend web services using Nodejs and stored dependencies using Node Package Manager NPM Used jQuery and AJAX calls for transmitting JSON data objects between front end and controllers and Utilized continuous integration and automated deployments with Jenkins Ansible and Docker Used Amazon Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon EC2 to deploy project into AWS and good experience with AWS storage services S3 Build Cassandra queries for performing various CRUD operations like create update read and delete also used Bootstrap as a mechanism to manage and organize the html page layout Managed developed and designed a dashboard control panel for customers and Administrators using Django Oracle DB PostgreSQL and VMWare API calls Involved in development of Python based Web Services using REST for sending and getting data from the external interface in the JSON format and perform analysis using Django PostgreSQL Designed automation scripts to back up the old records by using Mongo DB export command and transferred the files into backup machine with the help of ftplib Followed AGILE development methodology to develop the application and developed Golang API and chatbot using TDD to automate software deployments and rollbacks Used Test driven approach TDD for developing services required for the application and managed datasets using Panda data frames and MYSQL Queried the database queries using Python Developed the application using the TestDriven
