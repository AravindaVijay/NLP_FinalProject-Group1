and matured a SIEM directed developers on log development Constructed secure paths in the adoption of cloud technologies to get the agency to Work from Anywhere securely Network Load Balancing Environment Moved NCSoft from outdated and unsupported F5 Environment that was unstable lacked global redundancy and was severely vulnerable to malicious exploits I was able to re engineer the entire environment to scale globally with no downtime when previous attempts by F5 professional services left the US environment down for 2 days Network Firewall Redesign and MPLS implementation Redesigned and implemented each business office and datacenters firewalls to encompass newer secure technology greater hardware and connection redundancy While upgrading to new hardware I implemented site to MPLS over BGP to allow corporate data to traverse between offices and data centers as well as redundant routes to the internet and corporate resources based on availability of circuits Data Storage Designed implemented and directed new enterprise storage solution quintupling the previous implementations data storage capabilities at half the price of the previous system Enterprise Backup Solution Migrated the college from tape backups to disk backups using redundant backup nodes TCO dropped by 100k a year due to support changes tapeless backup and use of existing fiber connections to DR site

Engineer versed in architecting Risk Management Security Assessments and Operations Identity and Access Management SDLCSecDevOps and Secure Cloud Adoption for multibillion dollar verticals Key Career Achievements Information Security Program Worked to devise key elements and implement an Enterprise Information Security Program to bring the agency into the CyberAge Built log aggregators Architected and matured a SIEM directed developers on log development Constructed secure paths in the adoption of cloud technologies to get the agency to Work from Anywhere securely Network Load Balancing Environment Moved NCSoft from outdated and unsupported F5 Environment that was unstable lacked global redundancy and was severely vulnerable to malicious exploits I was able to re engineer the entire environment to scale globally with no downtime when previous attempts by F5 professional services left the US environment down for 2 days Network Firewall Redesign and MPLS implementation Redesigned and implemented each business office and datacenters firewalls to encompass newer secure technology greater hardware and connection redundancy While upgrading to new hardware I implemented site to MPLS over BGP to allow corporate data to traverse between offices and data centers as well as redundant routes to the internet and corporate resources based on availability of circuits Data Storage Designed implemented and directed new enterprise storage solution quintupling the previous implementations data storage capabilities at half the price of the previous system Enterprise Backup Solution Migrated the college from tape backups to disk backups using redundant backup nodes TCO dropped by 100k a year due to support changes tapeless backup and use of existing fiber connections to DR site located miles away Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Rollout Being only the second community college in the state to attempt a VDI rollout we were able to produce a fully functional and superb model for
