ability to learn and adapt to new technologies quickly Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Front End developer Meeami Technologies Santa Clara CA March 2016 to Present Description Project was to develop a single page web based application to efficiently speed up the user requests Authenticated users can access this application and for finding the plan of their future house and can access the services like finding a houses or land or to rent a house which are posted by the sellers and buyers and makes the user communication easy of different fields of people This is a UI project allowing the users communication easier and can use voice inputs for the expected output Responsibilities Developed dynamic web pages using HTML5 CSS3 jQuery ReactJS Bootstrap NodeJS and AJAX Produced content pages with CSS3 layout and style markup presentations and used JavaScript methods and properties Involved in building applications using ReactJS by building reusable UI Components Worked on Bootstrap LESS to develop User Interface with responsive design Created responsive layouts for mobile plot forms by created grid model using bootstrap Used JavaScript and GWT to update a portion of a web page thus reducing bandwidth usage and load time in web pages to get user input and requests and Developed dynamic frontends using ReactJS Involved in building applications using React JS by building reusable UI Components Used Redux to store data from multiple API endpoints Extensively used core features like Props and State Worked on React JS for developing UI using Sorting Pagination and rendering for search product page Used React JS to create Controllers to handle events triggered by clients and send request to server Used AJAX to reduce the network load and update only the certain components of the website Used ReactJS with Redux to create a single page web application with efficient data flow between the client and server and used to create Controllers to handle events triggered by clients and send request to server Involved in ReactJS for Data patterns which improves readability and made it easier to maintain larger apps and used ReactJS for declarative efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces Utilized a concept called Virtual DOM in ReactJS to create inmemory data structure cache enumerate the resulting differences and then update the browsers displayed DOM efficiently Used Babel to transpile ES6 and JSX into ES5 Worked with the project management tool BitBucket Performed the SynchronousAsynchronous file operations and created web server with the help of Express Using NodeJS Worked on Express Framework to set up middleware to respond to the HTTP requests with the help of NodeJS Gathered data from APIweb services via AJAXJSON calls and updating the DOM within the result sets Worked with Package managers NPM Bower and build tools Grunt Environment HTML5 CSS3 Bootstrap JavaScript Redux ReactJS MongoDB Web pack AJAX JSON RESTful Web Services NodeJS Grunt Karma GIT and Agile Java Developer Huddl San Jose CA November 2014 to January 2016 Description Project was to develop a web based application to efficiently speed up the background investigation process Administrator and normal user could use the application to register or update new clients information simply by dropping in the original document to the web application which the document could be in TXTCSV or Excel sheet format The application would perform the custom validation on the file which can catch any error before sending the file to the database User can also track the status of any further investigation and reviewing done on the document and download the error file if certain information from the file need to be updated Responsibilities Developed single page applications using Angular 2 Typescript HTML5 CSS3 and Bootstrap Worked in an Agile Scrum development methodology to ensure delivery of high quality work with monthly iteration also involved in sprint planning and retrospectives Followed the NTier architecture for the application development with DAL BLL and UI Involved in requirement gathering designing development UI reviews and maintenance Created Typescript reusable components and services to consume REST APIs using Componentbased architecture provided by Angular 2 Created reusable templates using Angular directives and worked with NPM package manager tools Node JS Good knowledge on using Angular APIs like angularhttp For making HTTP requests angularcommon Common core things including form validation angularrouterRouting for our entire app Implemented HTTP requests using Rxjs Observable library to handle multiple values over time Designed the page using Bootstrap and some custom CSS Good knowledge on creating services with Angular 2 injectable property as to make the service available for dependency injection when creating components Designed dynamic clientside JavaScript codes to build web forms and simulate process for a web application page navigation using Angular 2 Worked on unit testing for the Angular application using karma Called the Restful web service calls for POST PUT DELETE and GET methods Developed CSS3 to style page layouts navigation and pageloading spinner Extensively worked with making calls to WEB APIs to fetch the data from the back end as JSON response and parse it on the UI for DOMCSS Manipulation Collaborated with the front end design team and back end team and started converting the static files with the dynamic content with the data is retrieved from the database by the API calls Used Mercurial for managing source code by resolving merge conflicts that occur during collaboration of
