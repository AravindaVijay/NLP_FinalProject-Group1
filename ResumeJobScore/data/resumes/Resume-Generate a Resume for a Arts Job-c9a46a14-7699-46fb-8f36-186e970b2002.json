management Natural leader Unsurpassed work ethic Results oriented Relevant Experience In my time as the Director of Programming Arts at DSU I have drastically improved the bottom line of shows at the Cox Performing Arts Center and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded permanent improvements and endowments The Trailblazer Summer Concert Series at the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and 2016 By changing the way tickets are marketed I was able to generate a 30 increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year I have also created a scholarship program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported twelve students in 2016 I sought and obtained donations from the community in order to completely renovate the Cox Center s Green room and made permanent improvements to the aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound equipment All of this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University Experience 03 2014 to Current Director of Programming Arts

Zion National Park Before I came to DSU this outdoor theater was used for a handful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements incorporating concessions and catering seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol and structuring the programming around two series formats The first series is comprised of festival style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of music and marketed as a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an important well attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion National Park The second series is an original show called Sanctuary The Story of Zion which was written to correspond with the centennial celebration of our National Parks I co created produced and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and tech team This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be supported by the tourists who come to the area Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National Park though storytelling music and the unique usage of video projection to share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world class artists and climbers who call Zion home 01 2010 to Current Board of Directors Member Company Name City State SUSWA continues to be a creative force

decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of Programming I continue to own Spiral Studios but have turned day to day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers 01 1994 to Current Musician Company Name State As a touring performing musician I have had the opportunity to travel the world This musical ability has been the backbone of my

Concert Series in only one year I have also created a scholarship program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported twelve students in 2016 I sought and obtained donations

entrance to Zion National Park Before I came to DSU this outdoor theater was used for a handful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements incorporating concessions and catering seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol and structuring the programming around two series formats The first series is comprised of festival style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of music and marketed as a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an important well attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion National Park The second series is an original show called Sanctuary The Story of Zion which was written to correspond with the centennial celebration of our National Parks I co created produced and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and tech team This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would
