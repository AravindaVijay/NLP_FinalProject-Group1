QueueManager is a web application which is a migration project of existing SFCTI SFCTI is a customer call application where each agent will be present with a user interface to answer customer calls conference a call coldtransfer the call and perform many other call operations This application will be used by around 65000 agents The user interface was developed using Ember and the backend service which interacts with Ciscos cti library will be responsible for handling all the call operations and sending the data to UI We used websocket programming for the connection between UI and backend service I received several appreciations for my analysis on the complex and sporadic defects that we received during system testing Responsibilities Analysis of existing application Analysis of Business Requirements Discuss on the design of the application Develop the backend service using websockets Invoke tridion to get the configuration of Ciscos cti server Interaction with Ciscos Cti library and handle the various events that Cisco sends back Develop restful service to put the various events Cisco sends to Hadoop Use DPL script to lookup password to invoke Hadoop interaction services Invoke external interaction services using jaxrsclient Use good exception handling to avoid any possible issues Use GIT to maintain the code Participating in Daily scrum meetings Coordinate

January 2016 to Present Sr Java J2EE Developer StateFarm Bloomington IL January 2016 to December 2018 Description As part of this effort we developed 6 webservices 4 REST and 2 SOAP which are currently in production All these services basically write to kafka and read from hbase These services are consumed by different producers For example the above project QueueManager SFCTI is one of the producers Every interaction with the customer is stored into Hadoop This data is later used for calculating different facts like total interaction time total queue time total wrapup time etc We also developed two serializers in addition to the above services One serializer InteractionDataSerializer will be running in the Hadoop environment and it keeps reading the messages from kafka queue and puts them into Hadoop Another serializer InteractionFactSerializer also will be running in the Hadoop environment and it calculates the facts mentioned above I developed this fact calculator and also received appreciation from the project architect I also created a java restful service which interacts with apache solr to retrieve the search results based on given criteria Responsibilities Preparing the design documents Participating in Daily standups Coordinate with offshore on the requirements and defects Developed RESTful web services using IBM jaxrs rest framework Developed SOAP

Card Tool Replacement and Go To Market Role Sr Java J2EE Developer Description There were two projects scheduled to go live in November 2015 As the only Java developer available onsite I had to work on both the projects Credit Card Tool Replacement CCTR This project is an enhancement to the already existing application MailRx MailRx is a huge and existing application which consists of multiple screens developed using C for the pharmacists to work on the prescriptions In the existing application mailrx was using cybersource for the credit card payments but since Cignas contract with cybersource has expired the credit card functionality had to be replaced with the latest one In the existing functionality mailrx has a daemon CreditCardDaemon which keeps polling the sybase database for new requests and when it finds a new request it will process the request by interacting with CPM cybersource payment manager As an enhancement to the above the daemon was replaced by a service developed using apache camel which will invoke the cybersources ICS platform MailRx will invoke this service manually instead of inserting the records in the sybase The service will insert the request into the mysql database invoke the cybersource and then update the response in the mysql database The new service was developed using apache camel to perform the routing Springs JDBC template was used for queries in ms sql and spring aop and apache camel logging was used for logging purposes Go To Market GTM This project is also an enhancement to the MailRx Whenever there is an entry for specialty drug in the order mailRx has to invoke a new service developed using Apache Camel which will return the days supply allowed for that patient If the days supply entered for that patient is greater than the days supply returned from the service then a popup has to be shown to the user that there is a days supply limitation for that drug Otherwise the flow will proceed normally The new service has to invoke 2 external services using the memberId received in the request The first service will return the member details and the second service takes input from the first service and returns the days supply value For this we used apache camel to perform the routing Different error codes have to returned to the consumer based on the response from both first service and second service Spring AOP as well as apache camel logging was used for logging purposes Responsibilities Analysis of existing application Analysis of Business Requirements Prepare the schemas for request and response format for

QueueManager is a web application which is a migration project of existing SFCTI SFCTI is a customer call application where each agent will be present with a user interface to answer customer calls conference a call coldtransfer the call and perform many other call operations This application will be used by around 65000 agents The user interface was developed using Ember and the backend service which interacts with Ciscos cti library will be responsible for handling all the call operations and sending the data to UI We used websocket programming for the connection between UI and backend service I received several appreciations for my analysis on the complex and sporadic defects that we received during system testing Responsibilities Analysis of existing application Analysis of Business Requirements Discuss on the design of the application Develop the backend service using websockets Invoke tridion to get the configuration of Ciscos cti server Interaction with Ciscos Cti library and handle the various events that Cisco sends back Develop restful service to put the various events Cisco sends to Hadoop Use DPL script to lookup password to invoke Hadoop interaction services Invoke external interaction services using jaxrsclient Use good exception handling to avoid any possible issues Use GIT to maintain the code Participating in Daily scrum meetings Coordinate

January 2016 to Present Sr Java J2EE Developer StateFarm Bloomington IL January 2016 to December 2018 Description As part of this effort we developed 6 webservices 4 REST and 2 SOAP which are currently in production All these services basically write to kafka and read from hbase These services are consumed by different producers For example the above project QueueManager SFCTI is one of the producers Every interaction with the customer is stored into Hadoop This data is later used for calculating different facts like total interaction time total queue time total wrapup time etc We also developed two serializers in addition to the above services One serializer InteractionDataSerializer will be running in the Hadoop environment and it keeps reading the messages from kafka queue and puts them into Hadoop Another serializer InteractionFactSerializer also will be running in the Hadoop environment and it calculates the facts mentioned above I developed this fact calculator and also received appreciation from the project architect I also created a java restful service which interacts with apache solr to retrieve the search results based on given criteria Responsibilities Preparing the design documents Participating in Daily standups Coordinate with offshore on the requirements and defects Developed RESTful web services using IBM jaxrs rest framework Developed SOAP

Card Tool Replacement and Go To Market Role Sr Java J2EE Developer Description There were two projects scheduled to go live in November 2015 As the only Java developer available onsite I had to work on both the projects Credit Card Tool Replacement CCTR This project is an enhancement to the already existing application MailRx MailRx is a huge and existing application which consists of multiple screens developed using C for the pharmacists to work on the prescriptions In the existing application mailrx was using cybersource for the credit card payments but since Cignas contract with cybersource has expired the credit card functionality had to be replaced with the latest one In the existing functionality mailrx has a daemon CreditCardDaemon which keeps polling the sybase database for new requests and when it finds a new request it will process the request by interacting with CPM cybersource payment manager As an enhancement to the above the daemon was replaced by a service developed using apache camel which will invoke the cybersources ICS platform MailRx will invoke this service manually instead of inserting the records in the sybase The service will insert the request into the mysql database invoke the cybersource and then update the response in the mysql database The new service was developed using apache camel to perform the routing Springs JDBC template was used for queries in ms sql and spring aop and apache camel logging was used for logging purposes Go To Market GTM This project is also an enhancement to the MailRx Whenever there is an entry for specialty drug in the order mailRx has to invoke a new service developed using Apache Camel which will return the days supply allowed for that patient If the days supply entered for that patient is greater than the days supply returned from the service then a popup has to be shown to the user that there is a days supply limitation for that drug Otherwise the flow will proceed normally The new service has to invoke 2 external services using the memberId received in the request The first service will return the member details and the second service takes input from the first service and returns the days supply value For this we used apache camel to perform the routing Different error codes have to returned to the consumer based on the response from both first service and second service Spring AOP as well as apache camel logging was used for logging purposes Responsibilities Analysis of existing application Analysis of Business Requirements Prepare the schemas for request and response format for the services Preparing the design document and UML diagrams using Sparx Participating in Daily standups Coordinate with offshore on the requirements and defects Developing RESTful web services using
