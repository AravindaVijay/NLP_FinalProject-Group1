custom MVC framework MySQL Jquery IIS Apache Apache Tomcat NSIS This role began as a purely consulting role Team EDA provides a Software License Management solution for government and business entities such as NASA and Honda They had found that they were having issues with large databases so they asked me to review their database structure Myself I considered the software to be problematic because it ran on Windows servers that were often not sufficient to the role they performed and were built upon end of life versions of system programs that were intended primarily for Linux environments In the course of helping them I was then asked to create a Linux version of their software that would also install the core Linux dependencies that it would need This conversion was done for NASA and was dependent on a specific Red Hat environment Libraries and dependencies were installed using source code and had to fit into a Linux version of their graphical installer NSIS Web
