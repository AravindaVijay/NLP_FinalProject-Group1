January of 2010 Fully funded by a grant by the National Science Foundation American Astronomical Society 215th Meeting Washington DC January 2010 Funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation I assisted in the writing and compilation of programs C C LaTeX SuperMongo that modeled the spectral energy distributions of certain stars as well as generic simulations of Stellar Winds from different types of stars I presented the results at the AAS meeting in Washington DC Research Assistant East Tennessee State University East Tennessee US 2009 to January 2010 Writing programs C C to simulate stellar winds and model spectral energy distributions SEDs I became familiar with the documentation preparation system known as LaTeX I also became familiar with the interactive plotting and
