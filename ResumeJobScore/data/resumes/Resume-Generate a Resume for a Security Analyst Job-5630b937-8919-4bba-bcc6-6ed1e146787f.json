City CA April 2018 to Present Responsibilities Involved in requirements gathering analysis design development and implementation of various applications on MS SQL Server Good Knowledge of ETL Processes such source mapping transformation staging areas and created various ETL documents such as ETL Mapping documents Worked extensively through agile development methodology by dividing the application into iterations Strong understanding of source to target mappings used to build SQL tables and stored procedures Created complex functions and stored procedures using the multi part identifiers multi joins and TSQL that support both OLAP and OLTP applications Implemented Event Handlers Package Configurations Logging System and Userdefined Variables Check Points and Expressions for SSIS ETL Packages Executed SQL conversion prevalidation and postvalidation scripts to avoid data loss and to make sure that the Count redemption amount for each source matches the data loaded in EDW Developed stored procedures that generates header and detail files for different business processes Developed ETL package with different data sources SQL Server Flat Files Excel Source files etc and loaded the data into target tables by performing different kinds of transformations using SQL Server Integration Services Performed SSIS tasks such as Slowly Changing Dimension Conditional Split
