Credit Wise App Link httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomcapitalonecredittrackerhlen Scope here was to design develop Credit Wise an app to track and monitor the credit score of any individual regardless of any credit card company It maintains all the credit card accounts details like balance etc at one place and it alerts the users about changes in the Capital One credit score It lets you know the factors affecting the credit score Roles Responsibilities Followed Agile methodology with SCRUM framework to complete the project in iterations Coordinating with Architecture group on innovative designs and foundational infrastructural application changes Developed the application using MVP pattern Involved in the development of the Login authentication process using token services for the secure authorization and authentication on the application Collaborated on the UI Design migration to new views for a better and engaging user experience Worked on consuming the REST services by handling HTTP based REST API request and response by using Volley Integrated Google Analytics into the application to understand more about the users experience and preferences Used standard Android components like activities f services and created custom views for the application Implemented several types of Layouts for User Interface Developed UI layers with View Pager Navigation drawer and Fragments within the application Customized the UI controls like Buttons Tool bars etc Implemented Parcelable objects to send across activities Developed utility classes to handle Validations of user information using regex functions Used Async Tasks to avoid ANRs in the activity Dealing with the Shared Preferences to store User data and maintain the user login session Worked with Fiddler a tool used to debug GET POST API calls responses Involved in Continuous Integration Code optimization and troubleshoot issues as required Used Butter knife library for code optimization and performance tuning Used Lint tool to test the code redundancy usability security and performance Performed debugging using ADB commands and tested application in device using Logcat DDMS Involved in performing
