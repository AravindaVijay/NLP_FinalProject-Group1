Enterprise Class Network working both in the production and corporate environments West Marine has been working tirelessly in preparation for the launch of their new Ecommerce site leveraging a new production environment for scalability redundancy and PCI compliance The new environment will increase the sites content and ability to handle higher traffic loads while increasing redundancy at HQ and the datacenters Worked along with other Systems Engineers Network Engineers Architects and Project Managers to meet the deliverables on time Reducing the ticket queue volume and fielding any incoming tickets to assist the team Tasked with drafting a proposal for the new production Ecommerce mail gateway cluster with separate MX namespace isolated from the corporate mail traffic and mail gateway Redesigned the internal mail traffic route for internal hosts relaying mail to Exchange Installed and configured Anonymous Relay send connectors allowing full relay capability for specified hosts or networks With the current setup mail from internal hosts would relay mail to the Barracuda Mail Firewalls interface then back inside to exchange This setup is not best practice It lengthens the mail route and can cause possible mail queuing issues To achieve full relay functionality you must disable protection for mail spoofing and LDAP user lookups for valid email addresses The setup primarily weakens the Barracuda Mail Firewalls ability to be a firewall Processed mailbox restores for six users located on individual databases from tape backup to an Exchange 2007 Cluster using the

production Ecommerce mail gateway cluster with separate MX namespace isolated from the corporate mail traffic and mail gateway Redesigned the internal mail traffic route for internal hosts relaying mail to Exchange Installed and configured Anonymous Relay send connectors allowing full relay capability for specified hosts or networks With the current setup mail from internal hosts would relay mail to the Barracuda Mail Firewalls interface then back inside to exchange This setup is not best practice It lengthens the mail route and can cause possible mail queuing issues To achieve full relay functionality you must disable protection for mail spoofing and LDAP user lookups for valid email addresses The setup primarily weakens the Barracuda Mail Firewalls ability to be a firewall Processed
