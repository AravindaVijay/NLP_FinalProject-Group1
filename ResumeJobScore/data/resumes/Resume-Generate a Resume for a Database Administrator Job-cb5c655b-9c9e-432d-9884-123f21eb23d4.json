Electromagnetic System EMS San Diego CA Committed Software Engineer in Test with extensive experience in full life cycle of the software development process Proficient at designing and implementing test automation frameworks in various languages Excellent communication skills and a consistent team player in all sorts of environments Seeking new challenge with an expanding organization Work Experience Software Developer III in Test Electromagnetic System EMS General Atomics June 2016 to January 2019 Worked on Navys Advanced Arresting Gear AAG a system of computercontrolled machinery that catches airplanes landing on the new Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier The system has over 50 processors interconnected by a local network Software qualification testing is performed in an environment that simulates the physical equipment with realistic network communications between system software components and equipment software simulators HealthMap software is one of the components that provides status and health assessment to the entire AAG Worked with a scrum based agile team involved in the 4WireSimulators software bugs fixing and features implementation Resolved and fixed 4WireSimulators bugs and features within project time and budget Significantly reduced time and effort spent in manual testing by automating most of HealthMap test procedures Developed longterm
