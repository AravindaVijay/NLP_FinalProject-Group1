to review document and action on any changes or alerts to the internal ClearDATA environment including physical access log reviews tool maintenance and licensing reviews escalating internal AV alerts to IT for remediation or IDSIPS alerts to networking terminating former employee access Contributed to team development of a documentation request processCreated peerreview process to ensure that created documentation is reviewed and approved by another team member before being put into production to reduce errors and evaluate the usefulness of the document then provide feedback until the document is approved for production use and new Standard Operating Procedures are adopted Developed Python scripts for processing Salesforce tickets with known responses to filter out noise tickets
