quality ontime delivery Work Experience Software Developer Citi Bank Tampa FL February 2013 to Present Software J2EE platform with Oracle as the database Web Sphere 8 as application server Spring Tool suite as IDE Name of the Project CitiKYC Description of the Project Citi KYC Know Your Customer is a platform that performs due diligence when accepting or renewing periodically a business relationship This process ensures global and regional compliance with KYC regulations Customer Identification procedures CIPP and other regulatory requirements intended to protect Citi from being used for money laundering or other illegal financing activities This platform enables a single shared KYC record for the customer to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations and link related accounts to maintain a comprehensive understanding of clients and accounts throughout the bank and across the lines of business This project also involves establishment of relationship with new customers including but not limited to screening and Onboarding processes integrated with enterprise wide KYC repository having AntiMoney Laundering information thus creating a dynamic feedback loop This is an endtoend application development project involving requirements elicitation detailed design build testing implementation and support The system would be developed in multiple releases using the waterfall SDLC development methodology Role Technology Lead USPractitioner Responsibility Design develop test and deploy specific modules for software products Gather and document requirements and create high level and low level design artifacts Conduct proof of concepts POCs as necessary Deliver high quality code and conduct quality checks to ensure design requirements are met Conduct
