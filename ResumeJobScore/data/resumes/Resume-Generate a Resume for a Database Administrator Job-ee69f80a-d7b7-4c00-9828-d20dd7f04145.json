ordering application which allows user to order food online and to be delivered at residence or business FoodCrave has an mobile as well as an web application The custom application has many features like the restaurant login customer login Delivery driver modules and the Admin logins Responsibilities Designed front end and backend of the admin application using Python on Django Web Framework Responsible for all issues and enhancements of the Admin module Worked on AngularJS for the client facing application Used the Restful API and the Angular frontend Developed Restful microservices using Flask and Python and deployed on Heroku server Used HTML CSS AJAX JSON designed and developed the user interface of the website Developed views and templates with Django view controller and template Language to create a userfriendly website interface Develop consumer based features using Django HTML and Test Driven Development TDD Responsible for tracking and monitoring project status in JIRA Agile Developed Python web services for processing JSON and interfacing with the Data layer Worked on development of SQL and stored procedures for normalization and renormalization in MYSQL Build SQL queries for performing various CRUD operations like create update read and delete Used Django Database APIs to access database objects Increased the speed of preexisting search indexes through DJango ORM optimizations Developed a module to build Django ORM queries that can preload data to greatly reduce the number of databases queries needed to retrieve the same amount of data Python app which analyzed activity and response times code deployment and environment migration done in Amazon AWS Quick access to Amazon API Rendered Dashboard which provided important milestone Metrics Reduced the release cycle overhead by half Deployed and managed a private puppet infrastructure in AWS to deploy application Worked extensively on the Frontend with Bootstrap JavaScript and JQuery to optimize

designing The main focus is in Asset performance management manufacturing cyber security and many more web services Responsibilities Generated Use case diagrams Activity flow diagrams Class diagrams and Object diagrams in the design phase Created Python and Bash tools to increase efficiency of call center application system and operations data conversion scripts REST JSON and CRUD scripts for API Integration Automation of unit testing using Python Created server monitoring daemon with Psutil supported by Django app for analytic which I created Also researched big data solutions with Cassandra database Experience with Data migration from Sqlite3 to Apache Cassandra database Cassandra data model designing implementation maintaining and monitoring Build the Silent Circle Management System SCMC in Django Python and NodeJS while integrating with infrastructure services Strong Socket programming experience in Python Implemented complex networking operations like race route SMTP mail server and web server Used standard Python modules eg CSV Robot parser Iter tools Pickle Jinja2 Xml for development Managed developed and designed a dashboard control panel for customers and Administrators using Django HTML CSS JavaScript Bootstrap JQuery and RESTAPI calls Automated RabbitMQ cluster installations and configuration using PythonBash Used Pandas API to put the data as time series and tabular format for east timestamp data manipulation and retrieval Wrote Python library files to autopopulate optimal zoom polygon and tile info for the POIs testcase files This automation process reduces at least 50 of the manual effort Wrote a parser in Python to convert numerous types of tile testcase files tofrom csv files thus enabling QAs to directly modify in csvexcel saving overall QA time Sole engineer to build an App Engine application in Python jQuery CSS Cloud SQL together improvements ideas on existing workflows from all vendor staffs around the world Fetched twitter feeds for certain important keyword using Pythontwitter library Used Python library Beautiful Soup for web scrapping to extract data for building graphs Performed troubleshooting fixed and deployed many Python bug fixes of the two main applications that were a main source of data for both customers and internal customer service team Experience configuring AWS S3 and their lifecycle policies and to backup files and achieve files in Amazon Glacier Applied ETL for better system behavior and getting Best result with Database Executing regression tests on each release and verified bugs found from automation test in Bugzilla and Selenium IDE Conducted trainings for a group of employees about infrastructure management using AWSservices Developed webservices using Resteasy and Hibernate frameworks Developed inventory management system using SpringMVC frameworks Environment Python Django Resteasy SpringMVC Hibernate Linux HTML CSS MongoDB Web services SVN Pandas Bugzilla Python Developer October 2013 to April 2014 DESCRIPTION This application was designed to help the sales person take the survey of the Healthmart franchise store The sales representative used to fill the forms and come back and upload the responses on the sales force system There was an unnecessary effort put because Salesforce UI was not compatible with tablets they carried and did not support any offline usage So a new tablet web application was developed to give a rich interface with offline connectivity fix for each sales representative to handle the application Responsibilities Used Python and DJango to develop the Web modules Ensured high quality data collection and maintaining the integrity of the data Designed and developed the UI of the website using HTML AJAX CSS and JavaScript Designed and developed data management system using MongoDB Build SQL queries for performing various CRUD operations like create update read and delete Rewrite existing PythonDjango modules
