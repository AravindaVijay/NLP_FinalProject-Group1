our new dashboard technology thirdparty library developed by Kalitte Built the file explorer widget which allowed users to group and move files and other data Context menus a draggable UI layout a tree a table and interwidget drag and drop were all implemented in JavaScript Built a clientside dashboard for displaying different sets of environmental data Contained around 20 different charts built using HighCharts JavaScript library The user could set the number of rows and columns through the query string Charts had inherited methods and a life cycle inheritance achieved through the use of a mixin function Data from the server was changed from an array of data to a tree structure which was then used to provide filtering through drop down menus on each chart itself custom data structure now released on GitHub called Stor Realtime livedata enabled charting using data from REST APIs WCF REST services and web services utilized asmx HighCharts JavaScript charting library used for client side charts Pie line column bar stacked column wind rose candlestick charts implemented including charts with multiple series of different types Chart functionality extended to include user defined flags on data points and the ability to display ranges of data based on a 4character qualifier in a different color Daily and regular duties include Creating new dashboard widgets including
