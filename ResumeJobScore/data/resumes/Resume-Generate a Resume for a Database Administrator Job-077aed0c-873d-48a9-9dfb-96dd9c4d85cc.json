for lottery The system includes a main application server stores data on all tickets sold and the data on prizes that will be in the lottery machines local server is installed on the server distributors lottery application server located on slot machines Communication between the main application server and the local servers was carried out over VPN channels using Restful web service On this project I was the head of the module In our module we have developed an application server for a slot machine receiving data from the rolls socket between the slot machine and the local server My contribution to the project Broadcasted data in Java classes for further processing their server slot machine Developed a socket between the application server of the gaming machine and the local server Developed 8 components to exchange data through socket Developed a set of EJB Stateful that catered for client and a set of EJB Stateless for data layer Developed a management panel on JSF which also handles emergency situations power outage network unavailability etc Developed Integrated data layer with MySQL DB and used JPA Facade EJB Wrote the Restful web service to transfer data
