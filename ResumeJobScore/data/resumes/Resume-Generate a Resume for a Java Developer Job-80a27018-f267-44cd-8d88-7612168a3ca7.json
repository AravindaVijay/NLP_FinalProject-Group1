raising tickets Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Java Developer Virgin America Burlingame CA August 2018 to Present Project Mercury Description The Mercury Project targeted to provide a complex notification system for the airline company to monitor and manage all sort of messages as well as airline scheduling and status reporting information The project contains five phases and now the second phase has been initiated The main functionality is to build up a management system for the Virgin America administrative staff to monitor the airline scheduling info and send notifications under certain rules Based on the first phase the second phase needs to build up a new webbased user interface as well as database schemas according to the new requirements for the air scheduling system to cooperate with the legacy systems in Virgin America Responsibilities Involved in SDLC Requirements gathering Analysis Design Development and Testing of application using AGILE methodology Involved in using Core Java concepts Collections Exception Handling MultiThreading and Serialization JSON and XML for serializing data Used Spring Inversion of Control for injecting the beans and reduced the coupling between the classes while using MVC concept in design for both developing and testing purpose Designed and developed web user interfaces using Angular 4 HTML5 and jQuery providing a smooth transition Applied lambda expression using functional interface which brings better readability as well as streamlining complicated code Used Hibernate for mapping java classes with database to store ticketing information and created queries with Hibernate Query Language HQL for later testing Implemented Java and J2EE Design Patterns like Facade Abstract Factory Singleton Factory Data Access Object DAO Service Locator and Chain of Responsibility Developed Spring Framework based RESTFUL Web Services for handling and persisting of requests and Spring MVC for returning response to presentation tier Created Stored Procedures functions views indexes constraints triggers required SQL tuning to reduce the response time in the application Used Core Java concept like Multithreading Concurrency for performance and memory tuning for a friendly user interface Designed unit and integration test cases using Junit and used Log4j for logging error info and debug messages Used Jenkins plugins for code coverage and to run all the test before generating war file Used MAVEN as build tool and developed build file for compiling the code of creating WAR files Environment
