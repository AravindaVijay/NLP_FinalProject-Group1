ColdFusion and SQL Server to bring a fresh set of eyes to the brand new product Personal Achievements Realtime chat system with a NodejsRedis backend Sole individual responsible for maintaining and securing the remote web socket server for realtime functionality Used New Relic to diagnose a severe bottleneck and was able to propose a solution to management which ultimately resulted in a massive

a single time only thus removing half of the query overhead Proposed and implemented a solution to the known issue of storing blocks of text as static English phrases in the database and instead
