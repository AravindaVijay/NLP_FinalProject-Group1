experienced Data Scientist Computer Developer Bioinformatician with solid Biology Healthcare and Business background He is currently a Master student of Biomedical Informatics DBMI at Columbia University Medical Center He was also admitted by Georgia Institute of technology as the first cohort of the accredited online Master of Science in Computer Science program OMSCS Apart from that he won Wharton Foundation Series certificates offered by Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in his part time Currently Handong is conducting biomedical data analysis with Prof Chunhua Weng at Columbia Medical Center in domain of text mining information extraction natural language processing NLP and Health Information Exchange He has been doing research for over 4 years and has great passion in this area He has several publications available on PubMed with several in preparation Handong Ma is also a trained Web Developer and Software Engineer He built several websites httpplorzcom httpmachinitiescom and httphandongmacom Some of his sample projects can be found here httpsgithubcom18dubu Go check them out Apart from that Handong is a huge fan of startups He founded Plorz LLC

system enables efficient exchange of data from PCP and all specialists using standard CCD document Featured by its capacity of memorizing user preferences integrating prioritizing health data it sheds new light on current health information system design  autoVoxforge automatic speech recognition training testing system Project Designer developer autoVoxforge is a Python project aiming at automatically perform speech recognition and language modeling by Voxforge and Hidden Markov Model Toolkit HTK This system facilitates automation is the whole process of training testing on large corpus rather than the traditional manual way It partially solves the problem of data normalization which is a huge bottle neck in the whole process  EliTES clinical trial Eligibility Tracing and Estimation System Project designer developer In this study we first proposed the method of tracking clinical trial design information in predicting postmarket drug performance We focused on the eligibility focus shift between premarket and postmarket interventional drug trials and tried to assess its relationship with postmarket drug performances and possible side effects We found that it is possible to predict postmarket drug performances by integrating the design of eligibility section for interventional drug trials alone rather than waiting for trial outcome The manuscript is under preparation  httpmachinitiescom Personal Project machinitiescom is the website I built as a personal project It is the hub of my several projects including image recognition motion detection and other

expression considers RNA as the carrier of genetic information from DNA to protein However it has become more and more clear that RNA plays more important roles than simply being the information carrier Recently whole genome transcriptomic analyses have identified large numbers of dynamically expressed long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs many of which are involved in a variety of biological functions Even so the functions and molecular mechanisms of most lncRNAs still remain elusive Therefore it is necessary to develop computational methods to predict the function of lncRNAs in order to accelerate the study of lncRNAs Here we review the recent progress in the identification of lncRNAs the molecular functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs and the computational methods for predicting the function of

Institute of Technology HealthViz is a clean efficient health information visualization system Through this project we aim to improve the efficiency of Health Information Exchange HIE process The system enables efficient exchange of data from PCP and all specialists using standard CCD document Featured by its capacity of memorizing user preferences integrating prioritizing health data it sheds new light on current health information system design _____________________________________________________________________________ autoVoxforge automatic speech recognition training testing system Project Designer developer autoVoxforge is a Python project aiming at automatically perform speech recognition and language modeling by Voxforge and Hidden Markov Model Toolkit HTK This system facilitates automation is the whole process of training testing on large corpus rather than the traditional manual way It partially solves the problem of data normalization which is a huge bottle neck in the whole process _____________________________________________________________________________ EliTES clinical trial Eligibility Tracing and Estimation System Project designer developer In this study we first proposed the method of tracking clinical trial design information in predicting postmarket drug performance We focused on the eligibility focus shift between premarket and postmarket interventional drug trials and tried to assess its relationship with postmarket drug performances and possible side effects We found that it is possible to predict postmarket drug performances by integrating the design of eligibility section for interventional drug trials alone rather than waiting for trial outcome The manuscript is under preparation

Publications Molecular mechanisms and function prediction of long noncoding RNA httpwwwhindawicomjournalstswj2012541786abs 20121121 The central dogma of gene expression considers RNA as the carrier of genetic information from DNA to protein However it has become more and more clear that RNA plays more important roles than simply being the information carrier Recently whole genome transcriptomic analyses have identified large numbers of dynamically expressed long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs many of which are involved in a variety of biological functions Even so the functions and molecular mechanisms of most lncRNAs still remain elusive Therefore it is necessary to develop computational methods to predict the function of lncRNAs in order to accelerate the study of lncRNAs Here we review the recent progress in the identification of lncRNAs the molecular functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs and the computational methods for predicting the function of lncRNAs Additional Information
