the accounts are charged off and are passing accounting data to the recovery accounting component of CACS all accounting system functions eg payment posting accruals general ledger interface etc can continue The recovery mechanism of the CACS becomes the centralized repository for all charged off accounts providing recovery accountability capability if needed and the potential elimination of redundant recovery processing components for each portfolio of accounts The use of CACS recovery accounting allows for uninterrupted collections activity because the data is loaded to the recovery

the accounts are charged off and are passing accounting data to the recovery accounting component of CACS all accounting system functions eg payment posting accruals general ledger interface etc can continue The recovery mechanism of the CACS becomes the centralized repository for all charged off accounts providing recovery accountability capability if needed and the potential elimination of redundant recovery processing components for each portfolio of accounts The use of CACS recovery accounting allows for uninterrupted collections activity because the data is loaded to the recovery accounting component of CACS and the collection activities continue without delay Responsibilities Installed maintained upgraded and troubleshooted the cloudbased solutions including but not limited
