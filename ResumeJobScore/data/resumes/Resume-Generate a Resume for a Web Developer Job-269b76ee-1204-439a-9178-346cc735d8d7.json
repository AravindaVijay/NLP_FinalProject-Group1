and with some of the windows CMS tools in the year 1990s and slowly its being updated into latest versions of Visual studios and windows CMS and Our Program Director diverted the flow of CMS into Drupal 6 it was the most challenging part for us to completely migrate the application into Drupal 6 its been successfully migrated and works as per the standards In the next phase we need to upgrade the application into Drupal 7 We have successfully migrated the application into Drupal 7 there were number of challenges we face during the time of migration because there are so many thirdparty

migrate the application into Drupal 8 is which is under process We are using different tools for different project in order rectify and do not make any mess into the code base so for Pantheon project we are using Bitbucket tool for all the development and merging For our internal server application which Tektronix we have our own Data Centre in Beaverton we use JIRA for development and Bug fixing and for various tasks We have DMR Data migration Request portal to move the changes once the development Environment is ready for the test environment and then we use the same tool to move into production For the Mobile Project we use JIRA for the dev test and live Our goal in this project to use cloud service Pantheon instead of internal server which is creating an issue for different
