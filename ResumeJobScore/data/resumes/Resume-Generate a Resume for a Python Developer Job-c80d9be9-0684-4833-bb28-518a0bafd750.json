is an innovative submillisecond network delivery architecture that utilizes Gigabit Ethernet DWDM connectivity along with Layer 3 switching Led implementation effort for the successful platform upgrade of the LAN switches within all US POPs The upgrade was from the Cisco 4006 to the Cisco 6506E and eliminated the use of static CAM entries with PIM snooping Developed testing procedures 1Gbps and 10 Gbps DWDM circuits and to ensure endtoend IP connectivity following the addition of new provider access feeds Designed integrated and managed relational database to track the status of new circuit orders and provide real time status to the Circuit Provisioning and Technical Client Services teams resulting in a significant decrease in the time to turnup new client circuits and provided management with real time reporting capabilities Site Lead Network Engineer NMCI NETCO Govt Systems November 2003 to October 2005 Technical lead of 24x7 Network Operations for the Space And Warfare
