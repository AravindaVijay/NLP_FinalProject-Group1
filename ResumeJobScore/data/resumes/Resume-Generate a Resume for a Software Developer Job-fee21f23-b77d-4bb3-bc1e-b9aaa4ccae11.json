routers through IPSA IPSA is a product from Oracle which is a network management tool which communicates with all the routers on the network and configures the services on devices depending the request parameters it listening from the PAL Provisioning Application is a service provisioning solution that helps service providers in managing the Customer Edge devices Provisioning Application and IP Service Activator IPSA formulates the provisioning activation Provisioning Application and IPSA in conjunction deliver the required configuration on CE routers in managed customer scenario IPSA is used to configure Quality of Service QoS parameters on the CE routers The business services that are supported by this system are AVPN EVPN MIS and MRS Provisioning Application and IPSA gets service
