meant to create a Room Thermostat with Artificial intelligence The Room Thermostat is an HMI where user set the desired room temperature and future set points The thermostart sense the room temperature and calculate heat demad for room heater a fosil fuel based boiler a heat pump a electric heater based on user setpoints The AI thermostat would be connected to BOSCHCloud and send user ussage data regularly These user ussage data is analysed in cloud server to predict possible future ussage It will project possible energy consuption based on current ussage pattern and notify user accordingly to fill fuel for boiler It also predicts future service requirements of the boiler Responsibilities As a product architect i was responsible to design and develop Room Thermostat system Design Room Thermostat based on STM32 uc Design wifi interface and connect to cloud Coordinate with system architect to keep our product development inline with system requirement Derive product requirements and workpackages Do product FMEA Coordinate between HW and SW teams Derive Quality gates and their deadlines Review component designs Coordinate with components owners to keep component

Microcontroller used TC INFINEON TriCore Embedded OS ERCOSEK Description This project was meant to create different vehice platforms based on cost and geography Example low cost Medium Premium South American Asian Europian etc Implement new technologies in these platfoems according to its geographical preference For example ethanol is abudantly available in brazil so FlexFuel technology was implemented in South American platform variant We will implement a sensor in fuel tank which will sense the amout of ethanol mix in the gasolin accordingly it will trigger Engine controll unit to calibrate injection rate for a specific torque demand The platforms are targeted mainly for ECU based on TC INFINEON Tri Core After unit test MIL SIL HIL Labcar Test we do on vehicle test After passing all the test with a set of functionality we create platform baseline Which then get demonstrated to different OEMs to grab regular projects for BOSCH Responsibilities As a developer my role was to collect functional change requirment Analyze requirement Implement the design Do impact analysis do DRBFM do peer review Implement the change in c codeMATLAB model Integrate the changed code into platform software Build the platform software to generate HEX with no MISRA and build errors Flash and test it on ECU test it on LABCAR Apart From Project DRBFM L4 certified Certified FMEA

meant to create a Room Thermostat with Artificial intelligence The Room Thermostat is an HMI where user set the desired room temperature and future set points The thermostart sense the room temperature and calculate heat demad for room heater a fosil fuel based boiler a heat pump a electric heater based on user setpoints The AI thermostat would be connected to BOSCHCloud and send user ussage data regularly These user ussage data is analysed in cloud server to predict possible future ussage It will project possible energy consuption based on current ussage pattern and notify user accordingly to fill fuel for boiler It also predicts future service requirements of the boiler Responsibilities As a product architect i was responsible to design and develop Room Thermostat system Design Room Thermostat based on STM32 uc Design wifi interface and connect to cloud Coordinate with system architect to keep our product development inline with system requirement Derive product requirements and workpackages Do product FMEA Coordinate between HW and SW teams Derive Quality gates and their deadlines Review component designs Coordinate with components owners to keep component

Microcontroller used TC1796976667 INFINEON TriCore Embedded OS ERCOSEK Description This project was meant to create different vehice platforms based on cost and geography Example low cost Medium Premium South American Asian Europian etc Implement new technologies in these platfoems according to its geographical preference For example ethanol is abudantly available in brazil so FlexFuel technology was implemented in South American platform variant We will implement a sensor in fuel tank which will sense the amout of ethanol mix in the gasolin accordingly it will trigger Engine controll unit to calibrate injection rate for a specific torque demand The platforms are targeted mainly for ECU based on TC1796976667 INFINEON Tri Core After unit test MIL SIL HIL Labcar Test we do on vehicle test After passing all the test with a set of functionality we create platform baseline Which then get demonstrated to different OEMs to grab regular projects for BOSCH Responsibilities As a developer my role was to collect functional change requirment Analyze requirement Implement the design Do impact analysis do DRBFM do peer review Implement the change in c codeMATLAB model Integrate
