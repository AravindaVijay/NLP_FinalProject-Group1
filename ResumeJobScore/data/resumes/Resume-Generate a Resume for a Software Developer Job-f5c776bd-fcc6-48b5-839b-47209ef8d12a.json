Communications St Louis MO September 2017 to Present DescriptionDesigned developed modified and implemented web UI component and supported Charter Portals LegacyTS Web Application Developed Microservices for sending the BiDirectional Updates between Upstream and Downstream Applications All the modules are designed and developed using Java JavaScript Spring boot framework Scala AWS Cloud foundry REST services Responsibilities Follow Agile Methodology in analyze define and document the application which will support functional and business requirements Coordinate these efforts with Functional Architects Experience in Test Driven Development paired programming and Unit Testing Used Docker as a container for Creating Deploying and running application Deployed applications in Kubernetes Clusters running on Docker Hub Develop JavaSpring boot Based Microservices using Spring Boot Used MongoDB to enable them to build stand alone APIs faster handle highly diverse data types and manage applications more efficiently at scale Develop the Controller to handle the requests and responses Developed Microservices by using Spring boot Framework Used Core Java to develop Business Logic as Spring Beans Configure Spring Container to implement IOCDI of the Spring Beans and to manage the beans life circle Develop POJO objects and used Hibernate as the ObjectRelational Mapping ORM tool to access the persistent data from SQL Server Store procedure in the database and used Dynamic SQL to load the data Use Jersey to implement Restful Web Service and used XML form to transfer the data Use Rest Controllers to replace the existing operations layer which acts as bridge between business layer and the UI Using J2EE design patterns such as Business Delegate Service Locator Data Transfer Object Data Access Object Session Facade Factory method and Singleton pattern Used Spring Framework to load the classes and IOC module to inject the attributes of the Managed Beans Used JSON XML as response type in REST services Design and develop Restful web services using JAXRS Deployed the services and UI app on to AWS Cloud Foundry using Ocelot Security Developed reusable UI components using React JS Used Middleware ReduxPromise in application to retrieve data from BackEnd and to also perform RESTFUL services Involved in complete life cycle of software development including designing developing testing and deployment of application Involved in writing Service design documents and was part of Consumercalls during the handover of APIs Involved in writing Junit test cases to ensure Unit testing Component testing and integration testing are done before handing over to QA team Used Maven for dependency and configuration management to add dependent external jars and bundles run and deploy the application Used GitHub as code repository where Git is plugged in to IntelliJ IDE to commit files Experience in working on Web Services using Service Oriented Architecture SOA usingSOAP and Restful Web Services Expertise in major RDBMS concepts such as Oracle 12c11g10g MySQL MS Access and proficient in writing PLSQL Stored Procedures Triggers Views Very

Collections Framework and Java Multithreading to refresh the cache at a given set of time interval Involved in Design and development of application implementing MVC Architecture Implemented Hibernate ORM to persist the data into Database and wrote HQL based queries to implement CRUD operations on the data by using XML Developed Message Driven Beans MDB for asynchronous message consuming using JMS Involved in writing queries in Hibernate query language HQL and hibernate named queries Configured the Hibernate configuration files to persist the data to the Db2 Database Used JSON as response type in REST services Extensively used GIT version control system to coordinate with the team Involved in Performance and SQL Query Optimization Working on server side by using Spring Boot Spring Rest Service Implemented PLSQL queries and used Oracle stored procedures and builtin functions to retrieve and update data from the databases Deployed applications on WebSphere Application server Used Web
