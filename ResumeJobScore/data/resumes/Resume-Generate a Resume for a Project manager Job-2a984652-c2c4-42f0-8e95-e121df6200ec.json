of residence We can see whether there is an increased risk in your area of for instance an aviation accident natural fires or floods and you receive advice about what you must do in such a case The government is obliged to provide information about possible risks You will therefore be able to read precisely what the risks are what dangers they represent and how to protect yourself in an emergency Precautionary measures ensure that the risk of a large disaster actually occurring is exceedingly small The extent of a certain risk cannot be indicated in advance For instance if a toxic gas is released the danger zone will depend on the weather After all wind blows the toxic substances in a certain direction That is why the experts are cautious when estimating the danger zone
