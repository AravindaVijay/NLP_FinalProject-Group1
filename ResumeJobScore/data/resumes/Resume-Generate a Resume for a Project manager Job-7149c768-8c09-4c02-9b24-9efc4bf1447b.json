based on the number of the systems available processors to maximize efficiency Each thread is assigned a set of rows to calculate Each pixel read is converted to a HSB representation and is compared to a set of predefined colors to decide which color it closely represents using a simple a 3dimensional distance formula Threads then return all calculated colors to the parent to be converted into percentages to be later used as a comparator when organizing File Deposit httpsgithubcomMorningOwlFileDeposit_Productiongit Java A file backup system written with a group of students for a senior project at Kennesaw State University It was a clienttocloud project where a client software was created using components of the javaawt package while using Google Cloud Storage as backend JetS3t API was used to assist with coding methods related to connection and other communications between the software and Google Cloud The user would select a folder or a group of files and perform a scheduled task to create a backup copy of the files either locally or in the cloud Files are only loaded if they have been updated using a MD5 checksum condition Files loaded locally are done using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream while files loaded in Google Cloud use methods defined by JetS3t Singleton Logger httpsgithubcomMorningOwlJavaSingletonLoggergit Java This project is a logging program created with the intention of preserving logs that display program activities and errors to assist with debugging It is a selfinitiating class that allows the user to log any outputs of their program on the console andor into a log file The class was arranged to be threadsafe using synchronization and doublechecking methods where vital to prevent undesired outcomes MyLinkedList httpsgithubcomMorningOwlJavaMyLinkedListgit Java This was an attempt to produce a doublylinked list similar to Javas LinkedList class The MyLinkedList class contains a generic type similar that of Javas that will allow any type of objects to be stored Node is another generictyped class that acts as a bucket containing a stored element as well as the Node objects that are connected to that bucket The list contains a max size the current size of the list the first Node the last Node and the current Node Users could add and remove from the beginning or the end list It can also insert an array of elements as well as the standard get and set methods similar to that of LinkedList When retrieving an element of certain index it calculates which of stored Nodes is the closest first current or last and traverses to that index in relative to that Node This allows for a faster and efficient traversing Night Owl Productions Staffing System Microsoft SQL Server This is a web application that was designed for Kennesaw State Universitys FifthThird Bank Stadiums staffing department It allowed the department to effectively manage their student staffs and volunteers and better assign shifts to

on a color the user inputs Images are read using ImageIO and stored in a BufferedImage where a multithreading algorithm runs through each pixel returned by the reader The number of threads used is based on the number of the systems available processors to maximize efficiency Each thread is assigned a set of rows to calculate Each pixel read is converted to a HSB representation and is compared to a set of predefined colors to decide which color it closely represents using a simple a 3dimensional distance formula Threads then return all calculated colors to the parent to be converted into percentages to be later used as a comparator when organizing File Deposit httpsgithubcomMorningOwlFileDeposit_Productiongit Java A file backup system written with a group of students for a senior project at Kennesaw State University It was a clienttocloud project where a client software was created using components of the javaawt package while using Google Cloud Storage as backend JetS3t API was used to assist with coding methods related to connection and other communications between the software and Google Cloud The user would select a folder or a group of files and perform a scheduled task to create a backup copy of the files either locally or in the cloud Files are only loaded if they have been updated using a MD5 checksum condition Files loaded locally are done using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream while files loaded in Google Cloud use methods defined by JetS3t Singleton Logger httpsgithubcomMorningOwlJavaSingletonLoggergit Java This project is a logging program created with the intention of preserving logs that display program activities and errors to assist with debugging It is a selfinitiating class that allows the user to log any outputs of their program on the console andor into a log file The class was arranged to be threadsafe using synchronization and doublechecking methods where vital to prevent undesired outcomes MyLinkedList httpsgithubcomMorningOwlJavaMyLinkedListgit Java This was an attempt to produce a doublylinked list similar to Javas LinkedList class The MyLinkedList class contains a generic type similar that of Javas that will allow any type of objects to be stored Node is another generictyped class that acts as a bucket containing a stored element as well as the Node objects that are connected to that bucket The list contains a max size the current size of the list the first Node the last Node and the current Node Users could add and remove from the beginning or the end list It can also insert an array of elements as well as the standard get and set methods similar to that of LinkedList When retrieving an element of certain index it calculates which of stored Nodes is the closest first current
