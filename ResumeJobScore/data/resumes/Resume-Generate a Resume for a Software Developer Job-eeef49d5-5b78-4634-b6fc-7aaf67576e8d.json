performing correctly then removed virtual machines accounts from domain and deleted them Configured and implemented new backup solution As the companys data began to outgrow the existing tape backup solution I began researching a new solution that provided an immediate solution but that was also scalable for future growth of backup data size as the company to grow After careful research I decided to implement a Network Attached Storage NAS device as this best suited my companys needs Upon completion of the NAS integration into my network I adjusted all necessary SOP and DRP polices as well as

to transfer important financial and tax data between the firm and its clients I noticed it was not secure and on a legacy server that was starting to experience random hardware and software failures Upon noticing I immediately looked into a solution that would be quick secure and provide ease of use to our clientele not all of whom were very tech savvy I elected to use the Server version of
