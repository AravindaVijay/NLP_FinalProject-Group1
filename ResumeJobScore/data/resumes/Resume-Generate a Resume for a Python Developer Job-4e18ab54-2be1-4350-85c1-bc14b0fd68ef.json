Utilized a Raspberry Pi embedded system with a camera and a Python script to detect the area of a hand in a video The hand area was detected using skin color and contour detection It was then correlated with a range of sounds that were output from the embedded system in realtime Analogtodigital converters were used to connect 8 potentiometers to the systems GPIO ports These digital inputs were connected to a C program and used to select between various wave envelopes tones These wave envelopes were computed using harmonic analysis and Excel SSH was used to login to the Raspberry Pi to

Utilized a Raspberry Pi embedded system with a camera and a Python script to detect the area of a hand in a video The hand area was detected using skin color and contour detection It was then correlated with a range of sounds that were output from the embedded system in realtime Analogtodigital converters were used to connect 8 potentiometers to the systems GPIO ports These digital inputs were connected to a C program and used to select between various wave envelopes tones These wave envelopes were computed using harmonic analysis and Excel SSH was used to login to the Raspberry Pi to access and modify the software Link to design details and video of working device googlLupWKk Automated Skin Lesion Boundary Detection Cornell University Ithaca NY Aug Dec 2016 Designed computer vision software in a team of 3 to automatically segment skin lesions a necessary first step to automated skin cancer diagnosis The software was developed in C and included adaptive thresholding
