interests in all things new to me Im a pythonbashLinux scientific software hacker and enjoy getting my hands dirty with large amounts of data I have worked in the public and private sectors in areas ranging from computational chemistry to algorithmic trading to exercise physiology to name a few My education includes liberal arts geological sciences chemistry and geographical information systems GIS Im also a published author in fields including applied mathematics chemical physics computational drug design and biophysics Ive run my own business and worked for a startup or two as well as larger organizations as long as the work is engaging Im happy If you think Ill make a good addition to your team dont hesitate to contact me Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Data Scientist BSX Athletics Austin TX December 2015 to June 2016 Allaround data scientist researcher software developer and parttime exercise physiologist I specialized in gluing things together data schedules platforms and software I developed maintained and implemented software solutions for aggregating analyzing and visualizing large amounts of physiological timeseries data and I oversaw the data collection process too I also conducted physiology testing protocols and managed assimilated visualized and interpreted data from those tests I got my hands dirty in all parts of physiology testing If you came into our facilities for testing you know how handson I am I assisted our Marketing and Sales teams with data visualization and help explain technical narratives for larger audiences via channels such as blog posts I wrote software for our Customer Service team to ease parts of their workload and streamline serverside data reprocessing workflow Finally I supported optical engineering and hardwarefirmware development teams when needed Python Developer Texas Water Development Board Austin TX June 2015 to December 2015 Worked on scientific applications standalone

interests in all things new to me Im a pythonbashLinux scientific software hacker and enjoy getting my hands dirty with large amounts of data I have worked in the public and private sectors in areas ranging from computational chemistry to algorithmic trading to exercise physiology to name a few My education includes liberal arts geological sciences chemistry and geographical information systems GIS Im also a published author in fields including applied mathematics chemical physics computational drug design and biophysics Ive run my own business and worked for a startup or two as well as larger organizations as long as the work is engaging Im happy If you think Ill make a good addition to your team dont hesitate to contact me Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Data Scientist BSX Athletics Austin TX December 2015 to June 2016 Allaround data scientist researcher software developer and parttime exercise physiologist I specialized in gluing things together data schedules platforms and software I developed maintained and implemented software solutions for aggregating analyzing and visualizing large amounts of physiological timeseries data and I oversaw the data collection process too I also conducted physiology testing protocols and managed assimilated visualized and interpreted data from those tests I got my hands dirty in all parts of physiology testing If you came into our facilities for testing you know how handson I am I assisted our Marketing and Sales teams with data visualization and help explain technical narratives for larger audiences via channels such as blog posts I wrote software for our Customer Service team to ease parts of their workload and streamline serverside data reprocessing workflow Finally I supported
