performed by a person using the electromyography gyroscope accelerometer and orientation readings from the Myo gesture control Implementation of Column Store Database Management System Java SQLite Implemented a database management system that performs structured query language operations effectively on column stores by extending the modules of Java MiniBase Several tests were performed on the different components of the DBMS and the operation of the components were analyzed The tests that were performed with B Tree were interactive and led to an understanding of the Minibase DBMS One of the main reasons is that we can access the attribute needed directly instead of querying a whole tuple and also storage and indexing is simplex due to a single data type Java Minibase which is a database module for querying row store was used and extended it to query column store efficiently to perform operations like insert delete index scan sort join Sensor Fusion Image Processing Android Python Built two camera sensors Thermal camera and Color camera based food recognition Android application by performing Data Collection Server Design Android Design and Performance Matric Cluster computing system for largescale Geospatial Data Python Hadoop Spark Scala AWS SparkSQL PostgreSQL Analytics was performed on the New York taxi trip dataset by implementing spatial operations on a distributed Hadoop Spark cluster to obtain the top 50 hotspots in the city of New York Memory usage CPU usage and execution time from the results obtained in every phase were calculated and notable observations were made Execution time was reduced by 40 milli seconds cluster memory was increased by 6 and CPU usage was decreased by 10 Made use of the taxi dataset and found the hotspot using something called the zscore or the Getis ord where the probability of finding a taxi is high As the data was 300GB we created 3 nodes in AWS and installed Hadoop and Spark in each of them Hadoops HDFS was used for the data store and Spark for processing the data We collected the boundary data of New York city and used that with the data that was given and got the result using SparkSQL

Technology and Management IJHTM March 2016 January 2017 The biometric involved extracting the features from the ECG wave using Pattern recognition Neural Networks Wavelet transformation Genetic and Syntactic methods KNN and Weighted Thresholding were implemented A detailed procedure for implementing ECG as a biometric was performed and an accuracy of 98 for the standard 24 hour MITBIH arrhythmia database was obtained Faculty in the AmritaCognizant Innovation Lab February 2015 to April 2016 in performing a research on Real Time Object Detection and Identification to help the visually impaired February 2015 April 2016 The outcome of the research is a vision system with audio feedback to assist the visually impaired to grasp objects OpenCVPython and weighted matrix algorithm was used to find the desired object in the scene ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE Detecting the signs of American Sign Language using data mining techniques Python SQLite Tableau Implemented a model to detect the ASL signs performed by a person using the electromyography gyroscope accelerometer and orientation readings from the Myo gesture control Implementation of Column Store Database Management System Java SQLite Implemented a database management system that performs structured query language operations effectively on column stores by extending the modules of Java MiniBase Several tests were performed on the different components of the DBMS and the operation of the components were analyzed The tests that were performed with B Tree were interactive and led to an understanding of the Minibase DBMS One of the main reasons is that we can access the attribute needed directly instead of querying a whole tuple and also storage and indexing is simplex due to a single data type Java Minibase which is a database module for querying row store was used and extended it to query column store efficiently to perform operations like insert delete index scan sort join Sensor Fusion Image Processing Android Python Built two camera sensors Thermal camera and Color camera based food recognition Android application by performing Data Collection Server Design Android Design and Performance Matric Cluster computing system for largescale Geospatial Data Python Hadoop Spark Scala AWS SparkSQL PostgreSQL Analytics was performed on the New York taxi trip dataset by implementing spatial operations on a distributed Hadoop Spark cluster to obtain the top 50 hotspots in the city of New York Memory usage CPU usage and execution time from the results obtained in every phase were calculated and notable observations were made Execution time was reduced by 40 milli seconds cluster memory was increased by 6 and CPU usage was decreased by 10 Made use of the taxi dataset and found the hotspot using something called the zscore or the Getis ord where the probability of finding a taxi is high As the data was 300GB we created 3 nodes in AWS and installed Hadoop and Spark in each of them Hadoops HDFS was used for the data store and Spark for processing the data We collected the boundary data of New York city and used that with the data that was given and got the result using SparkSQL Implementation of global kmeans clustering algorithm Python Tableau Implementing the global kmeans algorithm that uses an incremental approach in obtaining the original clusters for the given data set
