Description AMIC Web based tool helps Austin Mutual Agents to complete New Auto Policy Home Policy Mobile Home Policy and Endorsements online The application helps agents gather information of the Driver Vehicle and other Coverage and insurance details and then send it through the application to validate against the POINT insurance system Agents can do a Quick Quote and can provide users a summary of the estimate of coverage and cost of the policy This is a complete Insurance Policy tool online for agents Responsibilities Involved in the analysis design and development and testing phases of Software Development Life Cycle SDLC Extensively worked on Servlets JSPs Struts and Tiles JavaScript Angular Ajax Expression language JSTL JSP custom tags Worked in Spring Framework for Dependency injection and integrated with Hibernate Created XML Web Services for transferring data between different applications Utilized Apache CXF web service stack for developing web services and SOAP UI and XMLSPY for testing web services Created custom use of modules and components which extend the elements and modules of core AngularJS Used SAX and DOM parsers to parse xml data and worked on XPATH to parse XML documents Worked on Hibernate 30 in data access layer to access and update information in the database Utilized Java Message Service JMS 11 for reliable and asynchronous exchange of information such as loan status report Used RAD Programming Techniques to develop and execute applications and to manage end to end tactical solutions to meet business applications Utilized JSON scripting language for transmitting data over connection Designed and developed Message driven beans that consumed the messages from the Java message queue and generated emails to be sent to the customers Used JBoss Application Server 40 as application server for build and deployment Worked on relational database design and writing SQL queries stored procedures views functions triggers cursors with Oracle Unit tested using JUnit Easy Mock Testing Framework for performance enhancement Used Log4J to capture the log that includes runtime exceptions Participated in SCRUM software
