attendance system which can help them to record the progress of students Attendance plays a major role in not only showing students presence in an organization but also helps the faculty to keep a record of all the personal information The main aim of this project is to set up a system which can help the organization in having a better testimony of all the personal information without any major problems occurring during the process Various organization have problems in maintaining students records in spreadsheets which requires manual entries and corrections But once this system comes to

to students and faculty there has to be an attendance system which can help them to record the progress of students Attendance plays a major role in not only showing students presence in an organization but also helps the faculty to keep a record of all the personal information The main aim of this project is to set up a system which can help the organization in having a better testimony of all the personal information without any major problems occurring during the process Various organization have problems in maintaining students records in spreadsheets which requires manual entries

are common attacks that can be launched by an adversary to disrupt communication in wireless multi hop sensor networks Many schemes have been proposed to mitigate or tolerate such attacks but very few can effectively and efficiently identify the intruders To address this problem we propose a simple yet effective scheme which can identify misbehaving forwarders that drop or modify packets
