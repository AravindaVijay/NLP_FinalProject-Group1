Developer Cisco San Jose CA March 2018 to Present Project Smart Labs IOE Description Provides an innovative approach to inventory management that addresses equipment loss and which will provide loss Prevention and ready easy access to available Asset equipment The system will allow the user to select an Asset on the given Asset device table after selecting the asset it will redirect to location of an Asset on the floor map so an engineer who needs a particular piece can find it immediately The user can filter the map based on provided icons such as Asset is available to use condition of the Asset status of the Asset etc And also user can check in and check out the Asset also will provide the alerts to Asset administration whenever a new Asset comes into the labfloorbuilding or moves out of the labfloorbuilding Basically application provides tracking locating equipment on map of Asset and the time spent looking for a piece of equipment is reduced lowers capital etc Responsibilities

Developer Cisco San Jose CA March 2018 to Present Project Smart Labs IOE Description Provides an innovative approach to inventory management that addresses equipment loss and which will provide loss Prevention and ready easy access to available Asset equipment The system will allow the user to select an Asset on the given Asset device table after selecting the asset it will redirect to location of an Asset on the floor map so an engineer who needs a particular piece can find it immediately The user can filter the map based on provided icons such as Asset is available to use condition of the Asset status of the Asset etc And also user can check in and check out the Asset also will provide the alerts to Asset administration whenever a new Asset comes into the labfloorbuilding or moves out of the labfloorbuilding Basically application provides tracking locating equipment on map of Asset and the time spent looking for a piece of equipment is reduced lowers capital etc Responsibilities
