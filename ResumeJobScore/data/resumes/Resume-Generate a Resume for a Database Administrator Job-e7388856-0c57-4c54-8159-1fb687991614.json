Sandia National Laboratories SAIC Greenbrier TN Work Experience Principal Software Engineer supporting Sandia National Laboratories SAIC March 2019 to Present Developing the Front End for Inside Sandia application where the data was either static or being retrieved from various Databased sources Integrated with the backend developer who delivered JSON data objects through services grouping related data and presenting in an intuitive User Interface that was built with HTML5 CSS3 precompiled from SASS modules Converting application from AngularJS to Angular 7Building pages in an ObjectOriented mythology allowed commonly used designpatterns for both JavaScript and HTML to create base templates which were then inherited from and extended to present a cohesive set of pages Page routing used lazyloading of page modules to reduce initial page load time Source code was stored and versioned using GitLab Unit testing used Jasmine and Karma Senior Software Engineer supporting Sandia National Laboratories SAIC February 2017 to February 2019 Developed the Front End for a Policies and Processes application where the data was being moved from Cascade server to Archer a GRC product Worked closely with the backendArcher developer who created php web services that converted XML result from Archer into JSON Objects Angular 4 was used to access these JSON objects through services grouping related data and presenting data to user in an intuitive User Interface that was built with HTML5 CSS3 precompiled from SASS modules Typescript and a smattering of native JavaScript and jQuery Using Angular allowed the application to be built relying heavily on reusable and common modules with complex layout logic using containers and templates Page routing used lazyloading of page modules to reduce initial page load time Source code was stored and versioned using GitLab Unit testing used Jasmine and Karma This project was built in 8 months and delivered the last week of Aug 2018 Mentored and aided an understaffed team in the conversion of an existing AngularJS application to Angular 6 using the expertise I learned from the previously mentioned Policies and Processes application Aided extensively in the restructuring of the existing portlets into Angular modules that were lazyloaded along with breaking out commonly used code snippets into reusable modules Converted existing CSS files into module level SASS files Source code was stored and versioned using GitLab Unit testing used Jasmine and Karma This project was built in 5 months and is being delivered the first week in Oct 2018 Senior Software Engineer Vignet Corp December 2016 to February 2017 Develop module and form based medical patient tracking software allowing patients to take surveys enter current medical data for programs that support the care of various cancer patient while preparing for engaged in and after care of cancer treatment plans Software is AngularJS based using AWS services for back end retrieval of data stored in a JSON format Extensive use of directives and controllers are the basis of building the forms and surveys that support numerous Cancer research programs Business logic is provided by binding business rules to form entities to create single and multipage surveys and forms for patient input Display of these program surveys and forms is accomplished combining HTML 5 elements SASS and Bootstrap while incorporating dynamic inline styles The source code is store in GitLab enabling developers to create task level branches from a main development branch to be merged after the task work is completed Gulp is used to serve development and QA environments with npm and bower to provide reusable components and modules Senior Software Engineer supporting Sandia National Laboratories SAIC March 2015 to December 2016 Support development or conversion of internal websites at Sandia National Laboratories Converting existing web applications from JBoss Java and Html4 based to RESTful applications using Laravel for webservices while using AngularJS as the front end JavaScript framework Extensive use of AJAX methods to retrieve JSON data sets to populate modular portlets of dissimilar personal and company information The front end was built with HTML5 CSS3 and leveraging Bootstrap3 and Sass to create responsive mobilefirst web applications Have created several prototypes for new application development using Angularjs Bootstrap SASS HTML5 and grunt to serve applications in a development environment as well as documenting applications using ngdocs performing automated testing with jasmine and protractor utilize grunt to create builds serve codebase and deploy applications Used gitgithub for source code repository and versioning Use bower and npm to create reusable bower components and node modules Mobile Web Application Developer Ravens Work January 2013 to March 2015 Develop web based mobile
