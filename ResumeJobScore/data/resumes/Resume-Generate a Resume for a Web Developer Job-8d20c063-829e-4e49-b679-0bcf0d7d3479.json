in order to listen to events that are happening at MailChimp servers for eg when users unsubscribe from Mailchimp the webhook I built will synchronize the coming information with our database Here I leveraged HTTP POST request that was sent by MailChimp and fetched the data we need and made a call to Hibernate DAOs to update our database Created an interfaces and used a service layer in this project so if future implementation of MailChimp API are changed most of the logic we have in place wont be changed Assisted Project Managers and Testers in writing test cases and scenarios that helped them to verify the correctness of each tasks Carefully documented designs and implementations in our internal wiki pages Implemented unit and Integration test cases using JUnit Created RESTfull
