Experience Senior ETL Developer Used Pentaho PHP Python Younique Lehi UT July 2017 to April 2019 to build a data warehouse in Redshift and datamarts in RDS Wrote a nested set tree implementation that took a previously 24 hour process and ran it in 10 minutes by porting the data intensive portion to a stored procedure on an RDS database Interfaces with Restful APIs to pull data from third party vendors for use in the the warehouse Designed a system whereby processes were tracked and any failures resulted in notifications to email and text messages July 2017 April 2019 Contract Developer CipherTooth American Fork UT December 2016 to July 2017 Developing an API in PHP for CipherTooths R3 Encryption and MItM The API will be delivered on a thumb drive or zip a file that will contain a modified version of XAMPP such that it can be loaded on a computer and supply a working demonstration a working API to Code against as well as documentation and the ability to test the encryption and the MItM detection Dec 2016 July 2017 Senior Developer ConnexionPoint Murray UT December 2015 to December 2016 in an AWS environment with RDS databases running a telecommunications platform called CallPro My three man team that designed an EDW system that implemented a starflake model for the data from CallPro NICE and ADP which required X509 certificate authentication and some proprietary sources into a single structure The database was segmented by name spacing for each client to make it easy to scale by spinning up servers to move the busiest clients to their own servers Metrics were tracked to keep the instance to keep it from getting full The database exported data to an Aurora platform for the reporting team to produce reports and dashboards I wrote an ETL tool in PHP with JQuery for the front end The backend was straight PHP and ran on an AWS Ubuntu server to avoid data charges In a foot race with the old tool My ETL moved 23 million records in 26 seconds The ETL tool and the import processes were launched via CRON jobs Dec 2015 Dec 2016 Lead Developer CipherTooth American Fork UT February 2013 to December 2015 I built security systems to detect Man in the Middle MIM Spoofing Phishing and listener attacks and generally replace SSL Some implementations are placed into websites using controls written for specific browsers which are then integrated with JQuery Some implementations involved developing libraries that are loaded or compiled into other programs to secure their communications One implementation was delivered as a plug in to Wordpress that used a web service to detect the intrusion and warn the user and website owner including tracking of attacks looking for patterns etc Feb 2013 Dec 2015 Lead Developer AutomaticallyYou American Fork UT December 2008 to February 2013 I developed a data driven client with Delphi that automated a hidden browser to access the DOM in that browser to automate interaction with web based services Some of the web services supported were Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn We pulled random selections from a MySQL database through a web service to post comments from the clients computer Metrics on activity were stored in the database I built the AutomaticallyYou website using PHP JavaScript and JQuery on a LAMP and WAMP platform Dec 2008 Feb 2013 Senior Developer Convertabase American Fork UT February 2004 to December 2008 I Developed a suite of data conversion tools applied for and was awarded a patent Assigned to Convertabase on these tools The tools read metadata from any database that supports SQL92 ODBC to build and validate steps A visual parser that can handle files theoretically Terabytes in size The tool autoparses COBOL records if the map file is available The tool was scalable across multiple servers ran multithreaded and can segment an ETL job across servers to increase throughput Through the years multiple databases ETL processes Data Warehouses custom tools were written and many data conversions were performed Feb 2004 Dec 2008 Senior Developer Affiliated Computer Services Draper UT August 2003 to February 2004 I helped build a medical claims workflow processing system that spanned four countries with a parameter driven workflow system running on MS SQL servers I developed a web based system for keying in characters unintelligible to OCR programs I wrote a data import program which imported records from a legacy system the import ran in less than a third the time of the previous import handling twice the data on the same hardware Aug 2003 Feb 2004 Senior Developer Aradyme Corporation American Fork UT November 2001 to August 2003 Designed and built a replacement for a proprietary database engine adding a thread safe record locking system The new engine improved performance Raw speed of reads writes by a factor of 14 to 1 Built a Kerberos based Client Server engine to move the system to a Client Server architecture Designed and built a new indexing method that indexed millions of records in milliseconds Nov 2001 Aug 2003 Senior Programmer Learnframe Draper UT February 2000 to October 2001 Designed and built a web implementation for the PLM

Experience Senior ETL Developer Used Pentaho PHP Python Younique Lehi UT July 2017 to April 2019 to build a data warehouse in Redshift and datamarts in RDS Wrote a nested set tree implementation that took a previously 24 hour process and ran it in 10 minutes by porting the data intensive portion to a stored procedure on an RDS database Interfaces with Restful APIs to pull data from third party vendors for use in the the warehouse Designed a system whereby processes were tracked and any failures resulted in notifications to email and text messages July 2017 April 2019 Contract Developer CipherTooth American Fork UT December 2016 to July 2017 Developing an API in PHP for CipherTooths R3 Encryption and MItM The API will be delivered on a thumb drive or zip a file that will contain a modified version of XAMPP such that it can be loaded on a computer and supply a working demonstration a working API to Code against as well as documentation and the ability to test the encryption and the MItM detection Dec 2016 July 2017 Senior Developer ConnexionPoint Murray UT December 2015 to December 2016 in an AWS environment with RDS databases running a telecommunications platform called CallPro My three man team that designed an EDW system that implemented a starflake model for the data from CallPro NICE and ADP which required X509 certificate authentication and some proprietary sources into a single structure The database was segmented by name spacing for each client to make it easy to scale by spinning up servers to move the busiest clients to their own servers Metrics were tracked to keep the instance to keep it from getting full The database exported data to an Aurora platform for the reporting team to produce reports and dashboards I wrote an ETL tool in PHP with JQuery for the front end The backend was straight PHP and ran on an AWS Ubuntu server to avoid data charges In a foot race with the old tool My ETL moved 23 million records in 26 seconds The ETL tool and the import processes were launched via CRON jobs Dec 2015 Dec 2016 Lead Developer CipherTooth American Fork UT February 2013 to December 2015 I built security systems to detect Man in the Middle MIM Spoofing Phishing and listener attacks and generally replace SSL Some implementations are placed into websites using controls written for specific browsers which are then integrated with JQuery Some implementations involved developing libraries that are loaded or compiled into other programs to secure their communications One implementation was delivered as a plug in to Wordpress that used a web service to detect the intrusion and warn the user and website owner including tracking of attacks looking for patterns etc Feb 2013 Dec 2015 Lead Developer AutomaticallyYou American Fork UT December 2008 to February 2013 I developed a data driven client with Delphi that automated a hidden browser to access the DOM in that browser to automate interaction with web based services Some of the web services supported were Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn We pulled random selections from a MySQL database through a web service to post comments from the clients computer Metrics on activity were stored in the database I built the AutomaticallyYou website using PHP JavaScript and JQuery on a LAMP and WAMP platform Dec 2008 Feb 2013 Senior Developer Convertabase American Fork UT February 2004 to December 2008 I Developed a suite of data conversion tools applied for and was awarded a patent Assigned to Convertabase on these tools The tools read metadata from any database that supports SQL92 ODBC to build and validate steps A visual parser that can handle files theoretically Terabytes in size The tool autoparses COBOL records if the map file is available The tool was scalable across multiple servers ran multithreaded and can segment an ETL job across servers to increase throughput Through the years multiple databases ETL processes Data Warehouses custom tools were written and many data conversions were performed Feb 2004 Dec 2008 Senior Developer Affiliated Computer Services Draper UT August 2003 to February 2004 I helped build a medical claims workflow processing system that spanned four countries with a parameter driven workflow system running on MS SQL servers I developed a web based system for keying in characters unintelligible to OCR programs I wrote a data import program which imported records from a legacy system the import ran in less than a third the time of the previous import handling twice the data on the same hardware Aug 2003 Feb 2004 Senior Developer Aradyme Corporation American Fork UT November 2001 to August 2003 Designed and built a replacement for a proprietary database engine adding a thread safe record locking system The new engine improved performance Raw speed of reads writes by a factor of 14 to 1 Built a Kerberos based Client Server engine to move the system to a Client Server architecture Designed and built a new indexing method that indexed millions of records in milliseconds Nov 2001 Aug 2003 Senior Programmer Learnframe Draper UT February 2000 to October 2001 Designed and built a web implementation for the PLM Pinnacle Learning Manager specifically reporting and data transfer I supported the implementation at several companies staying onsite thought implementation to facilitate ease of transition Designed and implemented a Client Server data conversion system to integrate the PLM with third party programs Designed and implemented a Java application to perform integration with a java based system and other systems I Wrote several JSPs for use on the companys demonstration and customer hosting servers Designed an AICC compliant import for information from AICC compliant CBT Courses using Delphi and XSQL for reporting Feb 2000 Oct 2001 Programmer Analyst Specialized in Data Y2K issues PowerQuest Orem UT August 1999 to February 2000 Designed and implemented inhouse applications to automate a
