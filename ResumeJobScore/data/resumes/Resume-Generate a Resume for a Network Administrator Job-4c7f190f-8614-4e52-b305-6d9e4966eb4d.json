encountered major obstacles over the last decade and is at a crossroads This paper presents data that was obtained during the National Workshop on Redefining Cyber Forensics NWRCF on May 2324 2017 supported by the National Science Foundation and organized by the University of New Haven Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed from twentyfour cyber forensics expert panel members This work identified important themes that need to be addressed by the community focusing on 1 where the domain currently is 2 where it needs to go and 3 steps needed to improve it Furthermore based on the results we articulate 1 the biggest anticipated challenges the domain will face in the next five years 2 the most important cyber forensics research opportunities in the next five years and 3 the most important jobready skills that need to be addressed by higher education curricula over the next five years Lastly we present the key issues and recommendations deliberated by the expert panel Overall results indicated that a more active and coherent group needs to be formed in the cyber forensics community with opportunities for continuous reassessment and improvement processes in place Additional
