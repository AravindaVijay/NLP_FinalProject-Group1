Publications Flexible textile antenna sensor for bioimpedance sensingA compact lowcost realtime interrogation system for dynamic interrogation of microstrip patch antenna sensor httpsuiadsabsharvardedusearchqjames20skilskyjsortdate20desc2C20bibcode20descp_0 This paper presents the realization of antenna sensors on flexible textile substrates for bioimpedance measurements A Tresonator technique was employed to characterize the dielectric constant of various textile materials and to evaluate how the human tissue functioning as the superstrate influence the effective dielectric constant This paper presents the development of a low cost interrogation system that can dynamically interrogate the antenna sensor and wirelessly transmit the acquired data to a smart
