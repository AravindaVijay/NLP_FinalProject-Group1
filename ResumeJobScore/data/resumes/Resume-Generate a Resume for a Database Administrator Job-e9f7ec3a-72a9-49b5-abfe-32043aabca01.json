Principal Data Engineer Cardlytics Atlanta GA May 2015 to May 2016 Worked in an Agile environment on the EDW Scrum team Worked on both maintenance and new development for the current data warehouse Analyzed the DEV QA UAT and Production instances and servers for optimizations for configurations and settings Modified and maintained the existing Cardlytics EDW SSAS cube Began a complete redesign on the Cardlytics EDW SSAS cube Wrote SSRS reports to allow a quick view into ETL processes Meta Data and system overview Drove the start of the EDW team meetings and code reviews to increase the communication between team members and improve the conformity of code being developed After analyzing the longest running step in the EDW load to understand the complexities of the current data model and the production server I designed a SSIS package that allowed for the asynchronous and concurrent execution of child packages through an execute process task The package would dynamically determine the best number of concurrent child packages to run and would manage the MAXDOP of all queries in the process The parent package tracked the execution of the child packages through constant logging of metadata available resources and process execution This changed dropped the average execution time of this step from 18 hours to 2 hours This process averages 40 concurrent child packages to utilize 70 to 80 percent of CPU while avoiding the  wait type that is indicative of too many concurrent queries or memory pressure Designed and developed the institution and customer dimensions for the new data warehouse This included modifying the proposed data model researching the current requirements understanding the shortcomings of the current dimensions and data model developing ETL packages a method for historical data load and thorough testing Technical Environment SQL Server 2014 SQL Server 2016 MS SSIS MS SSAS MS SSRS SQL Sentry ERWin Redgate Toolbelt Jira Git Senior DatabaseBI

best practices in moving tempDB to their own dedicated RAID 10 high performance drives And modified other data and log files to improve performance Modified maintenance jobs that were not currently rebuilding indexes The modifications performed rebuilds based on a fragmentation level greater than 30 for the majority of indexes Modified transaction log for databases that had large numbers of VLFs thousands in some cases This included creating transaction logs with appropriate sizes from the start of the modification and size based growth logic that would allocate space in a sensibly way as to not allow VLFs to grow out of control Removed forwarded records that had caused over 100 billion forwarded record reads in the last few months Followed a waits and queues methodology to find and improve performance problems Discovered a number of applications holding unused connections for long periods of times and worked with developers to modify connection logic Found contention in a number

on queries that are pulling from the new data mart Modified HP Compellent SAN configuration to improve performance by following best practices in moving tempDB to their own dedicated RAID 10 high performance drives And modified other data and log files to improve performance Modified maintenance jobs that were not currently rebuilding indexes The modifications performed rebuilds based on a fragmentation level greater than 30 for the majority of indexes Modified transaction log for databases that had large numbers of VLFs thousands in some cases This included creating transaction logs with appropriate sizes from the start of the modification and size based growth logic that would allocate space in a sensibly way as to not allow VLFs to grow out of control Removed forwarded records that had caused over 100 billion forwarded record reads in the last few months Followed a waits and queues methodology to find and improve performance problems Discovered a number of applications

Principal Data Engineer Cardlytics Atlanta GA May 2015 to May 2016 Worked in an Agile environment on the EDW Scrum team Worked on both maintenance and new development for the current data warehouse Analyzed the DEV QA UAT and Production instances and servers for optimizations for configurations and settings Modified and maintained the existing Cardlytics EDW SSAS cube Began a complete redesign on the Cardlytics EDW SSAS cube Wrote SSRS reports to allow a quick view into ETL processes Meta Data and system overview Drove the start of the EDW team meetings and code reviews to increase the communication between team members and improve the conformity of code being developed After analyzing the longest running step in the EDW load to understand the complexities of the current data model and the production server I designed a SSIS package that allowed for the asynchronous and concurrent execution of child packages through an execute process task The package would dynamically determine the best number of concurrent child packages to run and would manage the MAXDOP of all queries in the process The parent package tracked the execution of the child packages through constant logging of metadata available resources and process execution This changed dropped the average execution time of this step from 18 hours to 2 hours This process averages 40 concurrent child packages to utilize 70 to 80 percent of CPU while avoiding the RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE wait type that is indicative of too many concurrent queries or memory pressure Designed and developed the institution and customer dimensions for the new data warehouse This included modifying the proposed data model researching the current requirements understanding the shortcomings of the current dimensions and data model

and implementation of a data mart for bonds reporting Supported all current application database OLTP systems and OLAP systems Created conceptual logical and physical data models in support of projects and support Replaced the third party reporting and dashboard tool iPartnersSNL by reverse engineering reports and the extracts they were based on Created a star schema and ETL to load it from the extracts that had been going to iPartners Created SSRS reports based on queries that are pulling from the new data mart Modified HP Compellent SAN configuration to improve performance by following best practices in moving tempDB to their own dedicated RAID 10 high performance drives And modified other data and log files to improve performance Modified maintenance jobs that were not currently rebuilding indexes The modifications performed rebuilds based on a fragmentation level greater than 30 for the majority of indexes Modified transaction log for databases that had large numbers of VLFs thousands in some cases This included creating transaction logs with appropriate sizes from the start of the modification and size based growth logic that would allocate space in a sensibly way as to not allow VLFs to grow out of control Removed forwarded records that had caused over 100 billion forwarded record reads in the last few months Followed a waits and queues methodology to find and improve performance problems Discovered a number of applications holding unused connections for long periods of times and worked with developers to modify connection logic Found contention in a number of jobs that were being called and modified the jobs and Event Chains in SQL Sentry to remove contention and allow must better performance Wrote recommendation documents for SQL Server 2012 logging
