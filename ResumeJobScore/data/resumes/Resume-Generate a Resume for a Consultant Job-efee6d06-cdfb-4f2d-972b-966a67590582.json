years Marketing Communications 4 years Financial Analysis 4 years Public Relations 4 years Accomplishments To Whom It May Concern My name is Vincent Hall and I hate the One Size Fits All approach to business When marketing doesn t feel like marketing and people organically connect to your message you ve birthed a movement Gone are the days of the 1950 s where individualism rooted in autonomy allowed one to be labeled as the lone wolf and heroically conquer the Corporate Ladder Similarly business entities cannot survive the current globalized hyper competitive market through what I call Corporate Isolationism A business whether a start up or an established titan of industry must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with its audience My interest in business started when my friend s step father told me The only road to success is the one you build through work and creativity This statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand human behavior in what motivates one to buy but also the mechanics behind product positioning What about the product makes it appealing How can a business increase delivery efficiency How does a business drive up profit margins while driving down production costs In conclusion between my experience in accounting marketing research marketing strategy product positioning market communication and public relations has led me to believe two key things First individual s desire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation It has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds or less Second the product must serve a customer s need longer than the next fade of products In other words the product must withstand a competitor s product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options to every customer It is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing sales and accounting will assist in your company s profitability in product positioning Experience 05 2016 to Current Leasing
