Dissertation Projects A Time from 2014 January to 2014 Match Title the relationship between the mathematical grade of the seventh grade and grades from primary school Brief process use linear model to fit transformed variables from the data after getting rid of useless columns choose the most significant variables to form the final model based on persuasive diagnostic values Achievements from the project the mathematical grade of the seventh grade is significantly influenced by the reading counting and logistic ability at the first and second grade in the primary school B Time from 2014 May to 2014 August Title bike rental prediction Brief process construct the regression model use different statistical method find the most powerful model decided by finding the least error rate and decide which variables significantly enough to build the model Achievements from the project use Lasso to make the regression it gives the least error rate and use the almost original data set it saves a lot of time to deal with the original data set C Time from 2014 September to October Title Classify Song Release Period Brief process construct the classification model to classify a specific song into the year before or after the year 1986 based on 90 attributes of a single song and 6480 songs Achievements from the project use the Multivariate adaptive regression splines to build the model and based on the final classification model we can conclude that if the song is from before or after on 1986 depends mostly on the artists who create them secondly on properties they tagged by famous music website and finally on properties of their track D Time from 2014 November to 2014 December Title predict the lightening strikes in July based on the records from January to June Brief process first cluster the original data based on the lightening strike records and the moisture records with the method of K mean and Hierarchical method Second use different statistical method like Boosting Random Forest Ridge Lasso NNET CART SVM to find the best model to predict the strikes will happen Achievements from the project we use the K mean clustering method and based on the moisture data to form the cluster and use the neural network is a better way for our prediction to get a smaller MSE and lightning strike have direct relationship with the soil moisture level and the climate indices E Time from 2014 November to 2014 December Title predict the daily stock price of Netflix Inc Based on historical daily price records Brief process use GARCH model to fit the transformed data and finally choose the GARCH plus ARMAR model to make the forecasting Achievements from the project from the model we can find that there is a up trend in the future about this stock and this is a

data analysis introduction of probability theory statistical inference time series analysis survival analysis experimental design current development in statistics SAS advanced license Thesis Dissertation Projects A Time from 2014 January to 2014 Match Title the relationship between the mathematical grade of the seventh grade and grades from primary school Brief process use linear model to fit transformed variables from the data after getting rid of useless columns choose the most significant variables to form the final model based on persuasive diagnostic values Achievements from the project the mathematical grade of the seventh grade is significantly influenced by the reading counting and logistic ability at the first and second grade in the primary school B Time from 2014 May to 2014 August Title bike rental prediction Brief process construct the regression model use different statistical method find the most powerful model decided by finding the least error rate and decide which variables significantly enough to build the model Achievements from the project use Lasso to make the regression it gives the least error rate and use the almost original data set it saves a lot of time to deal with the original data set C Time from 2014 September to October Title Classify Song Release Period Brief process construct the classification model to classify a specific song into the year before or after the year 1986 based on 90 attributes of a single song and 6480 songs Achievements from the project use the Multivariate adaptive regression splines to build the model and based on the final classification model we can conclude that if the song is from before or after on 1986 depends mostly on the artists who create them secondly on properties they tagged by famous music website and finally on properties of their track D Time from 2014 November to 2014 December Title predict the lightening strikes in July based on the records from January to June Brief process first cluster the original data based on the lightening strike records and the moisture records with the method of K mean and Hierarchical method Second use different statistical method like Boosting Random Forest Ridge Lasso NNET CART SVM to find the best model to predict the strikes will happen Achievements from the project we use the K mean clustering method and based on the moisture data to form the cluster and use the neural network is a better way for our prediction to get a smaller MSE and lightning strike have direct relationship with the soil moisture level and the climate indices E Time from 2014 November to 2014 December Title predict the daily stock price of Netflix Inc Based on historical daily price records Brief process use GARCH model to fit the transformed data and finally choose the GARCH plus ARMAR model to make the forecasting Achievements from the project from the model we can find that there is a up trend in the future about this stock and this is a appropriate time to buy this piece of stock Experience Company Name May 2014 to August 2014 internship City State Main tasks of this job 1 Collect enter and analyze stock prices collect useful data
