httpsieeexploreieeeorgdocument6571640 201303 Pairwise and more generally twise testing are the most common and powerful combinatorial testing approaches This paper investigates the effectiveness of the twise approach for testing logical expressions in software in terms of its fault detecting capabilities Effectiveness is evaluated experimentally using special software tools for generating logical expressions and twise test cases simulating faults in expressions testing faulty expressions and evaluating effectiveness of the testing Twise testing effectiveness is measured in its totality and for specific types of faults it is then compared with random testing A detailed analysis of the experimental results is also provided Additional Information Methodologies Scrum UML RUP SDLC
