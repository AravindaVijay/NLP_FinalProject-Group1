request of the customers vendors or other sources preventive maintenance upgrades identified during the careful observations during maintenance or due to a repair call received by the network repair centersNCMS in its early stages is expected to provide all these features enforcing appropriate work flow and help the Network Services to organize many such change management projects around the strict SLA bound maintenance schedules While helping the network services in organizing these projects and tasks NCMS will provide appropriate notifications to individuals and groups that must be involved and progress notifications to interested parties Even in the early release NCMS is aligning with the next generation systems to reduce the duplication of data by accessing the appropriate
