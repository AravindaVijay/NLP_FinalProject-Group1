Sysyems CA July 2012 to April 2014 CUPM permits standard services such as phone line and voice mail etc to be ordered for subscribers It processes all changes to the underlying Cisco Unified Communications applications as an order All orders in the system are tracked and viewable both across orders and by subscriber name or ID A simple wizarddriven approach is used for ordering services It permits delegation of the order management capability so that requests for service additions changes or cancellations can be done without requiring an underlying knowledge of the voice applications that are delivering those services RESPONSIBILITIES Used AgileScrum methodology to develop the application Used various Core Java concepts such as Exception Handling Collection APIs to implement
