standardized process to build SQL servers using process automation including virtual server configuration ie at the OS level SQL Server installation and all postinstallation actions SQL Agent jobs alerts SQL configurations etc as well as integrating with a CMDB to maintain accurate server inventory This allows us to spin up virtualized SQL Servers with no manual effort Using NetApp snapshot technologies to clone databases to different servers principally for reporting purposes especially with the datawarehouse SQL 2012 AlwaysOn Availability Groups When they were first released I performed extensive research and testing on exactly how all of the components with AGs work with Windows 2012 clusters including Dynamic quorum management ie Last Man Standing Noderole draining and

Managing jobs across nodes Successfully initiated led and completed a project to virtualize Tier 2 and 3 production database servers with the completed architecture resulting in a fully consolidated set of dedicated hosts in their own VMWare cluster The goals of this project were to reduce physical server sprawl and reduce our SQL Enterprise licensing costs by over 60 saving almost 8 million After proving out how we could virtualize all other servers I led the effort to finish virtualizing our Tier 1 servers Built an audit process using SQL Audits Automation examples Compliance required that we not only segregate our nonproduction environments via firewalls but that we used separate nonproduction domain accounts for all services Built a mapping stored procedure which when restoring a database to nonproduction took all domain production service accounts which had permissions in that database matched the account to the corresponding nonprod account and duplicated the permissions Similarly I built a Powershell process to assign developers and QA groups permissions to folders and reports in restored SSRS databases since this cannot be done in TSQL We use the Ola Hallengren process for index maintenance which doesnt handle statistics updating well I built a procedure which updates statistics based on passed parameters eg more than 20 drift or less than 70 sampling ratio on last update This works with Olas CommandLog table to retain the history for single pane of view for maintenance activity Recent BI projects Working with development and reporting teams to

functionality testing monitoring application support and defect analysis Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Database Administrator IV Database Architect Zovio San Diego CA October 2012 to Present Started as the Principal DBA for Agile development RD teams working on the latest technologies in education support Projects included Assisting to build a 3TB virtualized clustered SQL 2012 datawarehouse OLAP environment including SSAS and crossdomain SSRS Working with automated deployments using Octopus TeamCity and TFS Building and maintaining 4 levels of new nonprod areas for the different parts of the release cycle DEV QA Staging and PLT Performance Load Testing NB This department was dissolved and all employees let go in 2013 Senior member of a 9person DBA team responsible for managing over 100 servers in production as well as more than 500 servers in nonproduction This infrastructure includes servers for inhouse products and processes as well as a number of 3rd party products including the two primary Tier 1 vendorprovided applications used to support the business Other responsibilities include Maintaining uptime including working with developers and vendors to troubleshoot performance and errors Participating in weekly oncall rotation which includes performing dozens of releases throughout the week as well as acting as first responder for alerts and issues Architecting and designing planned server infrastructure to ensure consistency and maintainability Mentoring nonsenior members of the team to help their personal development and growth as well as for the betterment of the team NB Over the years this team has been reduced to 2 DBAs plus the manager Projects include Worked with SCM team to design and develop a standardized process to build SQL servers using process automation including virtual server configuration ie at the OS level SQL Server installation and all postinstallation actions SQL Agent jobs alerts SQL configurations etc as well as integrating with a CMDB to maintain accurate server inventory This allows us to spin up virtualized SQL Servers with no manual effort Using NetApp snapshot technologies to clone databases to different servers principally for reporting purposes especially with the datawarehouse SQL 2012 AlwaysOn Availability Groups When they were first released I performed extensive research and testing on exactly how all of the components with AGs work with Windows 2012 clusters including Dynamic quorum management ie Last Man Standing Noderole draining and recovery for Windows patchingmaintenance Powershell and SQLCMD scripting of all cluster and AG configurations Architected and built a multisite multisubnet geodispersed Microsoft Windows 2012 Cluster supporting SQL 2012 AlwaysOn Availability Groups to support a new SOA infrastructure Built multiple other AG clusters with processes for Rebalancing nodes after failover Managing security across nodes Managing jobs across nodes Successfully initiated led and completed a project to virtualize Tier 2 and 3 production database servers with the completed architecture resulting in a fully consolidated set of dedicated hosts in their own VMWare cluster The goals of this project were to reduce physical server sprawl and reduce our SQL Enterprise licensing costs by over 60 saving almost 8 million After proving out how we could virtualize all other servers I led the effort to finish virtualizing our Tier 1 servers Built an audit process using SQL Audits Automation examples Compliance required that we not only segregate our nonproduction environments via firewalls but that we used separate nonproduction domain accounts for all services Built a mapping stored procedure which when restoring a database to nonproduction took all domain production service accounts which had permissions in that database matched the account to the corresponding nonprod account and duplicated the permissions Similarly I built a Powershell process to assign developers and QA groups permissions to folders and reports in restored SSRS databases since this cannot be done in TSQL We use the Ola Hallengren process for index maintenance which doesnt handle statistics updating well I built a procedure which updates statistics based on passed parameters eg more than 20 drift or less than 70 sampling ratio on last update This works with Olas CommandLog table to retain the history for single pane of view for maintenance activity Recent BI projects Working with development and reporting teams to holistically analyze not only their workload but the workload of the primary datawarehouse server and provide suggestions for improvement Methods for this include using DTA for advanced workloadlevel suggestions composite statistics filtered indexes etc using query store and manually analyzing top queries consuming CPUmemory resources Working with development team for building up machine learning systems SQL 2017 with R and Python integrated Working with development team to prototype and build Azure Data Factory and Data Lake v2 infrastructure and to integrate this with our noncloud datawarehouse Worked with SelfService reporting team to build infrastructure for Power BI using SSAS 2017 Tabular models including process for scaling out SSAS servers and making the models portable Working with solutions architects and platform engineers to design plans to reduce our datacenter footprint by converting applications and potentially databases to Microsoft Azure Cleaning out the
