Project GE Automation Environment UiPath Tortoise SVN Role RPA Developer Client General Electric Location Hyderabad Telangana Project Description Fin_147_1 Financial grid package automation This process intends to update the ledger filesExcel files downloaded from shared location pertaining to current financial quarter using Oracle smart view com addins and interacting with Oracle database through backend And once the files are updated bot uploads them to the shared location and will archive the initial excels files downloaded from the shared location After the completion of the process based on the outcome corresponding email notification will be sent to the user by bot Fin_148_1 Financial grid package automation In this process we connect to a Shared network location and download a mapping file Later the bot will connect to Oracle ebiz suite and run checks against pre decided validation rules in the current zone and download a file After downloading both the files bot will upload them to the shared drive and will notify the user through email Fin_143_1 Profit and cost center update in DRG In this process we connect Oracle DRG applications backend database and pull the data latest committed to the database after the last run After fetching this data bot will query another database for the company code details and will then perform VLOOKUP operations on both the data sets to generate a master table which is then iterated based on predefined workflows to generate an excel template file each time a flow executes successfully Later the bot will generate an service now ticket by attaching the generate files into it After successful completion of the process the end users are notified through an email notification In the event of an exception corresponding exception details are provided in the email notification Insurance Automation This process involves automation of the Insurance claim request data validations the bot fetches the incoming request details using an API call After fetching request details bot will now navigate through different web applications and will validate the inputs in the request against the data in applications Once all the validations the are successful bot will insert the request details into the database In the event of any exceptions the bot will insert the request details along with the exception message into another database table This automation also involves localization of the process to accommodate the various different business rules pertaining to various different statesregions Fin_GETS_101 This process involves automation of the invoice processing where the filed invoices are verified against a purchase order and are then validated for the acknowledgement or approval date from the client depending on the outcome of the validations the rebate rate is determined and a regular follow up is sent as per the gestation period of the invoice SAP User Access Automation This process aims to automate the adding modifying and deleting of the user profiles based on the email requests received by the bot and then updating the users with status of the requests Resource Reconciliation This automation ensures that the allocations to associates are aligned with compliance norms it verifies the resources allocated to the teams against the project and approved client ID And incase of any inconsistency alerts are triggered to the concerned managers and after certain alerts if there is no response then the login ID of the associate id is deactivated Project New Business Automation Environment UiPath Role RPA Developer Client TechM Location Hyderabad Telangana Project Description Process Details Process 1 The Process objective was to Validate the Invoice details of the client in the Backend Systems The bot picks up the work item from the excel file and then validate the fields in the file after successfully validating the fields the delivery address is confirmed from another application And the contents of the delivery package are verified with ones in the Invoice The requester will be notified via email after the successful completion of processing the work item In event of an exception The bot will capture the screenshot and will send it to the support team for investigation Process 2 The Objective of this was to capture details of the service ticket from the web based application and validate the details After validating the details the bot will update the back ends based on the business rules defined for the particular type of service ticket and it will complete the ticket and send email notification to the requester If the service ticket details are not valid then the bot will notify the user with appropriate error message Roles and Responsibilities Executing Process Screening and Identification through comprehensive process selection criteria Conducting Preautomation assessment on process complexity qualitative and quantitative benefits Performing processes prioritization for automation based on payback and stakeholders inputs Implemented UiPath User authentication by defining user roles creating users and setting password policies

during preautomation stage Collaborate with vendors and stakeholders at levels within and outside the company Project Ge water Insight Apps Environment Java Python Role Developer Client General Electrics Project Description GE Insight Water Apps is web application which is used to monitor the health of plant and its asset by analyzing the data from the various parameters of an asset based on the data analysis the reports are generated which are used to keep track of the health of various assets of a plant The part of the project in which am working deals with report generation which includes both front end and backend enhancements Front end is basically the user interface and backend is the service that supports profiling the front end The backend services are dealt with python and PHP So am working with some changes that is being done on the python side for better view of the already created reports There are also reports which are freshly developed for which entirely new services are written Then we are integrating the codes and the unit testing is being done Roles and Responsibilities Interacting with functional analysts and business process analysts to analyze understand and finalize the requirements Interacting with solution architects to analyze applicationservice architectures make proposals on designs Writing the Lowlevel Design Documents for the

Summary Project GE Automation Environment UiPath Tortoise SVN Role RPA Developer Client General Electric Location Hyderabad Telangana Project Description Fin_147_1 Financial grid package automation This process intends to update the ledger filesExcel files downloaded from shared location pertaining to current financial quarter using Oracle smart view com addins and interacting with Oracle database through backend And once the files are updated bot uploads them to the shared location and will archive the initial excels files downloaded from the shared location After the completion of the process based on the outcome corresponding email notification will be sent to the user by bot Fin_148_1 Financial grid package automation In this process we connect to a Shared network location and download a mapping file Later the bot will connect to Oracle ebiz suite and run checks against pre decided validation rules in the current zone and download a file After downloading both the files bot will upload them to the shared drive and will notify the user through email Fin_143_1 Profit and cost center update in DRG In this process we connect Oracle DRG applications backend database and pull the data latest committed to the database after the last run After fetching this data bot will query another database for the company code details and will then perform VLOOKUP operations on both the data sets to generate a master table which is then iterated based on predefined workflows to generate an excel template file each time a flow executes successfully Later the bot will generate an service now ticket by attaching the generate files into it After successful completion of the process the end users are notified through an email notification In the event of an exception corresponding exception details are provided in the email notification Insurance Automation This process involves automation of the Insurance claim request data validations the bot fetches the incoming request details using an API call After fetching request details bot will now navigate through different web applications and will validate the inputs in the request against the data in applications Once all the validations the are successful bot will insert the request details into the database In the event of any exceptions the bot will insert the request details along with the exception message into another database table This automation also involves localization of the process to accommodate the various different business rules pertaining to various different statesregions Fin_GETS_101 This process involves automation of the invoice processing where the filed invoices are verified against a purchase order and are then validated for the acknowledgement or approval date from the client depending on the outcome of the validations the rebate rate is determined and a regular follow up is sent as per the gestation period of the invoice SAP User Access Automation This process aims to automate the adding modifying and deleting of the user profiles based on the email requests received by the bot and then updating the users with status of the requests Resource Reconciliation This automation ensures that the allocations to associates are aligned with compliance norms it verifies the resources allocated to the teams against the project and approved client ID And incase of any inconsistency alerts are triggered to the concerned managers and after certain alerts if there is no response then the login ID of the associate id is deactivated Project New Business Automation Environment UiPath Role RPA Developer Client TechM Location Hyderabad Telangana Project Description Process Details Process 1 The Process objective was to Validate the Invoice details of the client in the Backend Systems The bot picks up the work item from the excel file and then validate the fields in the file after successfully validating the fields the delivery address is confirmed from another application And the contents of the delivery package are verified with ones in the Invoice The requester will be notified via email after the successful completion of processing the work item In event of an exception The bot will capture the screenshot and will send it to the support team for investigation Process 2 The Objective of this was to capture details of the service ticket from the web based application and validate the details After validating the details the bot will update the back ends based on the business rules defined for the particular type of service ticket and it will complete the ticket and send email notification to the requester If the service ticket details are not valid then the bot will notify the user with appropriate error message
