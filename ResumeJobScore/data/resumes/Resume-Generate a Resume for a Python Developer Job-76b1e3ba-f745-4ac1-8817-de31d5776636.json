Largescale Regional Failures httpieeexploreieeeorgdocument7928978reloadtrue 201704 Network virtualization is a key tool for enabling the scalable support of a wide range of distributed applications and services such as cloudbased services largescale distributed scientific computing and content distribution over a common physical network infrastructure One of the challenging problems related to network virtualization is the mapping and provisioning of virtual networks VNs over physical network infrastructures 14 where virtual nodes and links of a given VN request need to be mapped to physical nodes and paths that can provide enough computingswitching and networking resources respectively When provisioning VNs over a physical network a critical issue is that of resiliency VN service may require the ability to continue functioning in the event of scenarios such as equipment failures largescale disasters or malicious attacks In particular regional failures may cause a series of cascading failures and result in a huge impact and a severe economic loss so appropriate mechanisms must be put in place to protect against such occurrences In this paper we aim to provide resilient VN mapping against largescale regional failures by provisioning sufficient isolation eg regiondisjoint between primary and backup VN infrastructures CostEfficient Virtual Network Function Chaining over NFVbased Network Infrastructures Network Function Virtualization NFV is promising to help the service providers to reduce their investment cost and shorten the cycle of network service deployment and upgrade through implementing virtual network functions virtual nodes on standardized commodity hardware One of the open challenges is how to efficiently place and chain a set of virtual network functions on the physical network infrastructure to optimize the utilization of the underlying physical computing and networking resources In this paper we mathematically formulate the virtual network function chaining problem using Integer Linear Programming ILP to facilitate an optimal solution In addition we propose a set of heuristic algorithms to efficiently solve this problem In particular we propose a novel Close to Destination Chaining CDC algorithm which can achieve a very low network cost close to that of the ILP results with a low computing complexity We conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithms and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDC algorithm",

Largescale Regional Failures httpieeexploreieeeorgdocument7928978reloadtrue 201704 Network virtualization is a key tool for enabling the scalable support of a wide range of distributed applications and services such as cloudbased services largescale distributed scientific computing and content distribution over a common physical network infrastructure One of the challenging problems related to network virtualization is the mapping and provisioning of virtual networks VNs over physical network infrastructures 14 where virtual nodes and links of a given VN request need to be mapped to physical nodes and paths that can provide enough computingswitching and networking resources respectively When provisioning VNs over a physical network a critical issue is that of resiliency VN service may require the ability to continue functioning in the event of scenarios such as equipment failures largescale disasters or malicious attacks In particular regional failures may cause a series of cascading failures and result in a huge impact and a severe economic loss so appropriate mechanisms must be put in place to protect against such occurrences In this paper we aim to provide resilient VN mapping against largescale regional failures by provisioning sufficient isolation eg regiondisjoint between primary and backup VN infrastructures CostEfficient Virtual Network Function Chaining over NFVbased Network Infrastructures Network Function Virtualization NFV is promising to help the service providers to reduce their investment cost and shorten the cycle of network service deployment and upgrade through implementing virtual network functions virtual nodes on standardized commodity hardware One of the open challenges is how to efficiently place and chain a set of virtual network functions on the physical network infrastructure to optimize the utilization of the underlying physical computing and networking resources In this paper we mathematically formulate the virtual network function chaining problem using Integer Linear Programming ILP to facilitate an optimal solution In addition we propose a set of heuristic algorithms to efficiently solve this problem In particular we propose a novel Close to Destination Chaining CDC algorithm which can achieve a very low network cost close to that of the ILP results with a low computing complexity We conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithms and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDC algorithm",
