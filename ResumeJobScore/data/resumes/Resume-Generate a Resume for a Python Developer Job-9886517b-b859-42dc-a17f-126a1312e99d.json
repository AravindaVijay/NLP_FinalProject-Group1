handson enterprise IT experience with expert knowledge in LinuxWindows Cloud Architecture Automation Databases Networking Security Programming and Web Development Managed and architected private cloud and data center architectures with a high level of success One of my core competencies is Linux and Windows administration Scripting SAN Storage Continuous Integration Automation Openstack and AWS I have a broad range of knowledge and expertise in the field of IT having worked with many technologies Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Systems and Network Administrator Southwest Research Institute May 2013 to Present Helped architect a private cloud running Openstack from concept to production Part of this process involved moving each VM gradually off of each compute node and preparing it to run on OpenStack setting up the networking SAN storage and Fiber Channel configurations Set up the OpenStack Controller nodes to run PostgreSQL with Gluster as the method for storing Glance images and instances The operating systems involved in the migration were a combination of Windows Server and Centos Linux A combination of Puppet and Ansible are used to maintain base configurations on each system Implemented massive amounts of scripted procedures on each server to help automate backupsreporting in PowerShellBASH Manage CICD automation using Jenkins and puppet for production configuration management As part of the new infrastructure I am project lead on dockerizing the current applications to be run on Openshift Project lead on architecting the disaster recovery of web applications storage and databases across multisite datacenters Used Dell SAN storage replication along with incremental snapshots to ensure high availability for critical services Managed a full Windows environment complete with Active Directory DNS DHCP Group Policies and Certificate services Auditing was configured on Active Directory to adhere to NIST requirements to track changes made to the whole environment There were approximately 100 nodes total between Windows and Linux servers and roughly 500 desktop systems running mostly Windows Managed System Center Configuration Manager 2012 and successfully replaced it with Desktop Central to manage server and workstation patching in an automated fashion Key Achievements Implemented Openstack architecture to run critical production workloads for Linux and Windows Created web application high availability with HAProxy load balancers Implemented a DMZ Linux infrastructure with Confluence Jira Bitbucket and a WebDAV file sharing resource Implement and administer Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager and Operations Manager Created key Jenkins build processes and pipelines Managed Active

of handson enterprise IT experience with expert knowledge in LinuxWindows Cloud Architecture Automation Databases Networking Security Programming and Web Development Managed and architected private cloud and data center architectures with a high level of success One of my core competencies is Linux and Windows administration Scripting SAN Storage Continuous Integration Automation Openstack and AWS I have a broad range of knowledge and expertise in the field of IT having worked with many technologies Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Systems and Network Administrator Southwest Research Institute May 2013 to Present Helped architect a private cloud running Openstack from concept to production Part of this process involved moving each VM gradually off of each compute node and preparing it to run on OpenStack setting up the networking SAN storage and Fiber Channel configurations Set up the OpenStack Controller nodes to run PostgreSQL with Gluster as the method for storing Glance images and instances The operating systems involved in the migration were a combination of Windows Server and Centos Linux A combination of Puppet and Ansible are used to maintain base configurations on each system Implemented massive amounts of scripted procedures on each server to help automate backupsreporting in PowerShellBASH Manage CICD automation using Jenkins and puppet for production configuration management As part of the new infrastructure I am project lead on dockerizing the current applications to be run on Openshift Project lead on architecting the disaster recovery of web applications storage and databases across multisite datacenters Used Dell SAN storage replication along with incremental snapshots to ensure high availability for critical services Managed a full Windows environment complete with Active Directory DNS DHCP Group Policies and Certificate services Auditing was configured on Active Directory to adhere to NIST requirements to track changes made to the whole environment There were approximately 100 nodes total between Windows and Linux servers and roughly 500 desktop systems running mostly Windows Managed System Center Configuration Manager 2012 and successfully replaced it with Desktop Central to manage server and workstation patching in an automated fashion Key Achievements Implemented Openstack architecture to run critical production workloads for Linux and Windows Created web application high availability with HAProxy load balancers Implemented a DMZ Linux infrastructure with Confluence Jira Bitbucket and
