Consultant Patrick Engineering Inc Lisle IL July 2016 to Present Patrick Engineering Inc Patrick is a nationwide engineering design project management and technology firm of about 250 employees based in the Chicago area My current boss badly needed help managing his team and projects so he recruited me into the company in 2016 Our GIS team was a small and relatively new technical fish in a big engineering pond Subsequently we needed a unique structure for our contracts I created our Proposal Process detailing the handoffs and deliverables for creating drafting reviewing and approving our client agreements I crafted templates for the process including the Proposal itself a task and estimating sheet and an engagement model for contracts involving ongoing maintenance and support In December 2016 my boss was inundated with other duties so I began comanaging the team with three others Two years later I took over the entire team performing a variety of managerial tasks to help the team prosper and maintain high productivity quality and timely project delivery and job satisfaction On day 2 of my orientation I observed that Patricks social media presence was lacking I championed to the President for increase activity in LinkedIn which led to a seat on a committee that developed Patricks Social Media Policy I have been responsible for training our LinkedIn company page admins including creation and maintenance of all the training materials Our LinkedIn postings have gone from one every 6 months to over 1 per week on average In addition to managing multiple projects I have overall delivery responsibility for all our geospatial work and I am often brought in when there are challenges In 2018 a sister teams project was in jeopardy due to delays in getting data from an overtaxed team member I was unfamiliar with the project but stepped in to cover for the project manager working weekends and evenings to coordinate data delivery and report status to the executive and management team IT Manager Project Manager Consumers Energy Jackson MI May 2000 to July 2016 Consumers Energy is a public utility providing electric and natural gas service to over 66 million customers in Michigan I was inspired to major in Computer Information Systems while working parttime at the company as I attended junior college After I earned my Bachelors degree I joined Consumers officially as a developer and for the next 16 years it was an exciting ride through increasingly complex projects and roles that provided an invaluable amount of human and technical experience In 2009 I became Team Lead for a group of talented individuals supporting our SAP EAM module and integration to our mobile field application ABBs Service Suite Three years later my boss needed someone to take over our Outage Management SystemGIS team supporting Schneider Electrics Responder and Esris ArcGIS software The team had lost several members as well as their lead and they were challenged with a lot of large complex projects With both of these teams I worked closely with our business partners to ensure quality costefficient and timely endtoend delivery of projects enhancements breakfixes and operational support During storm electrical outages every available resource is needed I was involved in Storm and Crisis duty in several capacities for the better part of a decade As lead for the SAP EAM team I managed and was a participating member of a 24x7 oncall support rotation I also took a lead role on crisis calls to coordinate troubleshoot issues and determine root causeThis led to a Storm Management oncall rotation where I provided firstline support for the storm team during major weather events I coordinated system health reports and led mitigation of any technology issues for quick resolution As a Team Lead one of my responsibilities was to ensure quality and timely project delivery for projects within my teams responsibility area Projects ranged from 100K to 40 Million multiyear efforts and were often fraught with issues and burned out team members I frequently got pulled into estimatingtask breakdown workshops and issue mitigationI also took lead roles in SOWRFP creation approvals requirements gathering review and approval of documents and cutover planning From 2000 2009 I went from developer to Tech Lead on larger and more complex projects taking on just about every role in the Software Development Life Cycle Our biggest project was a big bang SAP implementation that spanned nearly 3 years I started that journey doing complex data mapping and then led

including creation and maintenance of all the training materials Our LinkedIn postings have gone from one every 6 months to over 1 per week on average In addition to managing multiple projects I have overall delivery responsibility for all our geospatial work and I am often brought in when there are challenges In 2018 a sister teams project was in jeopardy due to delays in getting data from an
