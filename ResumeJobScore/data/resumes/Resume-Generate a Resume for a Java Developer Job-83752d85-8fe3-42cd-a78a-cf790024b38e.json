established in June of 1988 In 2004 CCP redesigned the Parts Supply Chain to include contracting 3rd party support for purchase order management and distribution of parts CCP continues to work with customers to support initiatives and projects According to the current state the parts for the refrigerator vending machine is manufactured by a thirdparty company called Neterprise also the data of these parts is being handled by Neterprise The main aim of the project is to fetch those data from Neterprise bring it to the MDM System and then to the PIM User Interface master those data using MDM and PIM functionality and then push them back to downstream The data coming in MDM goes through a process of match and merge to remove redundancy and duplicity Here in PIM the data that comes from the upstream needs to be imported into the PIM system using import template Then those parts data need to be aligned to their specified images and then match and merge is performed in order to get the best version of truth After that the data has been exported out of the PIM system by creating export templates in the form of csv xsls txt etc RESPONSIBILITIES Extensively working on Installation
