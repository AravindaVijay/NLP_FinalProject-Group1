Maven Eclipse JIRA UNIX Java developer SLK technologies Bengaluru Karnataka March 2010 to December 2012 Description This is an Intranet application for shopping online within the community The member of the community sitting at his home or office can shop different items belonging to different categories like Stationary Electronic Goods Apparel Furniture Vehicles Home need appliances etc in the store belonging to that community The mode of payment is through their membership Card An Updated record is delivered every month to the concerned member so those dues may be deducted from his membership account Adequate security features were incorporated into the Project Another record maintains stock update Responsibilities Extensively use of Core Java features including collection exception handling generics and annotation in the logic tier to implement the mortgage calculator algorithms such as monthly payment for fix rate and ARM Designed the backend server build web service to provide result and generate report and the frontend user interface Developed Presentation and validation layers using JSP HTMLand CSS3 Custom Tag Libraries Retrieved data from the Restful web service for calculation using AJAX call Developed JUnit test cases for DAO and Service Layer methods Extensively used JQuery validation package to make client side user input validation Used JSP JavaScript and JDBC to create web Servlets Created tables in database based on the Entityrelationship model that is provided by the database architect Used SVN for version control Used IBMRAD7 as IDE
