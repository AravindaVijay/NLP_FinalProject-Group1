Cybersecurity and Forensics Student Organization CSFCO April 2017 to April 2019 Publications Aetacraft Home Lab httpswwwaetacrafttk 201212 Since 2012 Ive continued to work on my own private home lab computer network Dubbed the name Aetacraft due to the multiple worlds and ages that we have on our Minecraft sever This home lab has been with me since I was still in high school and started when me and my friends wanted to have a way to store and share large files and talk back and forth to each other about video games Today Aetacraft has become so much more then that with the addition of multiple web servers SQL servers and even an email server Aetacraft has grown with me throughout my high school and college career As I have become more knowledgeable and proficient in computer security system administration and programming I have applied what I have learned to my home lab I know the hardware it runs isnt the best and the subject matter of gaming isnt the most professional I am still quite proud of it and it has helped give me some context when learning things in the classroom helped me learn and helped guide me to what I should learn next in my own selfstudy I am quite proud of it for what it is and I hope that pride and excitement translates to the user On this website I have everything from a live map of our Minecraft Server which still runs to this day thanks to a custom BASH script that I wrote which manages it 247 to my own personal blog which I use to jot down ideas and discoveries that Ive had that I want to share with the world Like Ive said there is more to this Aetacraft project then just the website I have web servers database servers email servers and others Twin Cities Inn Website httpsfadablerecruits000webhostappcomindexphp 201901 As part of Metropolitan State Universitys Computer Information Technology CIT and Computer Science programs all students are to have taken part in an ambitious software engineering project from scratch from the Inception phase to the start of the deployment phase in the RUP software design process This project required us to combine all of the things that we learned in school while facilitating good teamwork planning and time management skills It included gathering all of the requirements designing the project using proper software modeling methods Creating a database beginning software construction design and implement proper test cases for the software While presenting our models and existent prototypes in between the various phases of the project Our group made up of Boahen Gyan Cheng Lor Colin Joselyn James Herzog and Jonathan Tseng Did our project on an imaginary hotel located in the Twin Cities called Twin Cities Inn Our goal was to create a functional website that would in short allow users to login book a room store a credit card on record and I will admit the site is NOT PCI DSS compliant pay for the room and gain fictional reward points after booking a room I will admit its not the best by any means However I think it was a good step in learning how to design a piece of software from start to finish For our project presentations we ran the website locally on our laptops however we did also put it on a freely available hosting provided called 000WebHostcom The website is not guaranteed to work perfectly on the hosting providers website there are a few known issues with the website on the hosted server which didnt appear when hosting it locally But it still gives a good idea of what we created and how it looks The full code for the website can be found on our github repository found here httpsgithubcomck2294ypHotelManagementSystem Linux Backup Script Summer Programming Project httpsgithubcomjaherzog574LinuxBackupScript 201812 One of my programming summer projects that Ive been working on for the past few years was in reference to my Linux servers and my need to keep them all backed up to my ZFS Linux file server that I have also running on my network I have spent several days onandoff writing this script and Ill admit its not the best thing in the world but it does what I wanted it to and it was good exercise in BASH programming again Im not really focused on computer programming IronMC Server Wrapper Summer Programming Project  201804 Another programming summer projects of mine A major part of my home lab was the Minecraft server it is after all why I call it Aetacraft in the first place One day I decided to try to make our Javabased Minecraft server stay always running restarting ifwhen it crashes while still allowing me to bring it down for maintenance when I needed to However In my true overkill fashion I couldnt just do that to go and make something that would speak directly to the Minecraft server provide me with a separate persistant server console so that I could get to the server console locally or just buy SSHing into the machine something that could take care of scheduled restarts world backups and saves and would handle all of the nuances and issues of the game from a lower level then just a simple plugin would reach A truly fire and forget solution that would almost make running a Minecraft server effortless So I devised this script which is really a fork of an already existing project and added what I wanted to it scheduling world saving backups and restarts automatic crash restarts and the like I also wanted it to actually check if the server was up and running and open to traffic and not just sitting at a server crash screen Additional Information Core Skills 1 Linux Administration 2

Cybersecurity and Forensics Student Organization CSFCO April 2017 to April 2019 Publications Aetacraft Home Lab httpswwwaetacrafttk 201212 Since 2012 Ive continued to work on my own private home lab computer network Dubbed the name Aetacraft due to the multiple worlds and ages that we have on our Minecraft sever This home lab has been with me since I was still in high school and started when me and my friends wanted to have a way to store and share large files and talk back and forth to each other about video games Today Aetacraft has become so much more then that with the addition of multiple web servers SQL servers and even an email server Aetacraft has grown with me throughout my high school and college career As I have become more knowledgeable and proficient in computer security system administration and programming I have applied what I have learned to my home lab I know the hardware it runs isnt the best and the subject matter of gaming isnt the most professional I am still quite proud of it and it has helped give me some context when learning things in the classroom helped me learn and helped guide me to what I should learn next in my own selfstudy I am quite proud of it for what it is and I hope that pride and excitement translates to the user On this website I have everything from a live map of our Minecraft Server which still runs to this day thanks to a custom BASH script that I wrote which manages it 247 to my own personal blog which I use to jot down ideas and discoveries that Ive had that I want to share with the world Like Ive said there is more to this Aetacraft project then just the website I have web servers database servers email servers and others Twin Cities Inn Website httpsfadablerecruits000webhostappcomindexphp 201901 As part of Metropolitan State Universitys Computer Information Technology CIT and Computer Science programs all students are to have taken part in an ambitious software engineering project from scratch from the Inception phase to the start of the deployment phase in the RUP software design process This project required us to combine all of the things that we learned in school while facilitating good teamwork planning and time management skills It included gathering all of the requirements designing the project using proper software modeling methods Creating a database beginning software construction design and implement proper test cases for the software While presenting our models and existent prototypes in between the various phases of the project Our group made up of Boahen Gyan Cheng Lor Colin Joselyn James Herzog and Jonathan Tseng Did our project on an imaginary hotel located in the Twin Cities called Twin Cities Inn Our goal was to create a functional website that would in short allow users to login book a room store a credit card on record and I will admit the site is NOT PCI DSS compliant pay for the room and gain fictional reward points after booking a room I will admit its not the best by any means However I think it was a good step in learning how to design a piece of software from start to finish For our project presentations we ran the website locally on our laptops however we did also put it on a freely available hosting provided called 000WebHostcom The website is not guaranteed to work perfectly on the hosting providers website there are a few known issues with the website on the hosted server which didnt appear when hosting it locally But it still gives a good idea of what we created and how it looks The full code for the website can be found on our github repository found here httpsgithubcomck2294ypHotelManagementSystem Linux Backup Script Summer Programming Project httpsgithubcomjaherzog574LinuxBackupScript 201812 One of my programming summer projects that Ive been working on for the past few years was in reference to my Linux servers and my need to keep them all backed up to my ZFS Linux file server that I have also running on my network I have spent several days onandoff writing this script and Ill admit its not the best thing in the world but it does what I wanted it to and it was good exercise in BASH programming again Im not really focused on computer programming IronMC Server Wrapper Summer Programming Project httpsgithubcomjaherzog574IronMC 201804 Another programming summer projects of mine A major part of my home lab was the Minecraft server it is after all why I call it Aetacraft in the first place One day I decided to try to make our Javabased Minecraft server stay always running restarting ifwhen it crashes while still allowing me to bring it down for maintenance when I needed to However In my true overkill fashion I couldnt just do that to go and make something that would speak directly to the Minecraft server provide me with a separate persistant server console so that I could get to the server console locally or just buy SSHing into the machine something that could take care of scheduled restarts world backups and saves and would handle all of the nuances and issues of the game from a lower level then just a simple plugin would reach A truly fire and forget solution that would almost make running a Minecraft server effortless So I devised this script which is really a fork of an already existing project and added what I wanted to it scheduling world saving backups and restarts automatic crash restarts and the like I also wanted it to actually check if the server was up and running and open to traffic and not just sitting at a server crash screen Additional Information Core
