Vehicle Data Definition Services VDDS a master data management system for all invehicle module and intermodule communication specifications is a foundational enabler for Connected Vehicle Services VDDS provides data services for CAN DBC files Part II specifications PARSED module specifications etc These services are used by CVDA for vehicle data access configuration setup and CVFMA for robust feature definition In addition VDDS scope includes reference definition services used to decode all data flowing out of the vehicle before downstream consumption The system manages the complexity of specification variance by vehicle platform and other factors and also ensures data integrity and timely availability VDDS has main three components CARMon RDR and PARSED CARMon Enabler The CAN Access via Remote MONitor enabler is a design capability and corresponding definitions established by the Advanced Research team to provide the ability to access invehicle message signals and diagnostic data conditional upon predefined operations CARMon data groups include CAN Signals Diagnostic Data RDR Enabler Remote Diagnostic Request is the functionality developed as part of the B2 feature delivery that can be used to trigger various diagnostic service requests from the cloud to the vehicle via a Telematics Control Unit for any Electronic Communication Unit ECU over the Controlled Area Network CAN bus The B2 design will be incorporated to be part of the larger CVDA enabler and AVD feature capability in B4 introducing more rigor in the structure and the formatting of the request PARSED Enabler Processing and Reporting System for Efficient Dataupload PARSED provides a unified system for accessing vehicle ECU deep data that is not currently accessible via the vehicle network Due to current vehicle network bandwidth limitations some level of data compression is necessary to provide the fidelity of information while maintaining bus utilization requirements for the vehicle PARSED is intended to Provide an aggregation structure and transmission method for internal software variables that are located in the software of an ECU that might not be transmitted on the vehicle bus Aggregate already available data into smaller data structures to be transmitted over high cost data transmission methodologies at a reduced cost without sacrificing data integrity Provide a unified

TFS Windows 10 Sr Java Developer FORD MOTOR COMPANY MI November 2017 to December 2018 Description Vehicle Data Definition Services VDDS a master data management system for all invehicle module and intermodule communication specifications is a foundational enabler for Connected Vehicle Services VDDS provides data services for CAN DBC files Part II specifications PARSED module specifications etc These services are used by CVDA for vehicle data access configuration setup and CVFMA for robust feature definition In addition VDDS scope includes reference definition services used to decode all data flowing out of the vehicle before downstream consumption The system manages the complexity of specification variance by vehicle platform and other factors and also ensures data integrity and timely availability VDDS has main three components CARMon RDR and PARSED CARMon Enabler The CAN Access via Remote MONitor enabler is a design capability and corresponding definitions established by the Advanced Research team to provide the ability to access invehicle message signals and diagnostic data conditional upon predefined operations CARMon data groups include CAN Signals Diagnostic Data RDR Enabler Remote Diagnostic Request is the functionality developed as part of the B2 feature delivery that can be used to trigger various diagnostic service requests from the cloud to the vehicle via a Telematics Control Unit for any Electronic Communication Unit ECU over the Controlled Area Network CAN bus The B2 design will be incorporated to be part of the larger CVDA enabler and AVD feature capability in B4 introducing more rigor in the structure and the formatting of the request PARSED Enabler Processing and Reporting System for Efficient Dataupload PARSED provides a unified system for accessing vehicle ECU deep data that is not currently accessible via the vehicle network Due to current vehicle network bandwidth limitations some level of data compression is necessary to provide the fidelity of information while maintaining bus utilization requirements for the vehicle PARSED is intended to Provide an aggregation structure and transmission method for internal software variables that are located in the software of an ECU that might not be transmitted on the vehicle bus Aggregate already available data into smaller data structures to be transmitted over high cost data transmission methodologies at a reduced cost without sacrificing data integrity Provide a unified access point for cloud based analytics Responsibilities Actively participated in sprints and

Vehicle Data Definition Services VDDS a master data management system for all invehicle module and intermodule communication specifications is a foundational enabler for Connected Vehicle Services VDDS provides data services for CAN DBC files Part II specifications PARSED module specifications etc These services are used by CVDA for vehicle data access configuration setup and CVFMA for robust feature definition In addition VDDS scope includes reference definition services used to decode all data flowing out of the vehicle before downstream consumption The system manages the complexity of specification variance by vehicle platform and other factors and also ensures data integrity and timely availability VDDS has main three components CARMon RDR and PARSED CARMon Enabler The CAN Access via Remote MONitor enabler is a design capability and corresponding definitions established by the Advanced Research team to provide the ability to access invehicle message signals and diagnostic data conditional upon predefined operations CARMon data groups include CAN Signals Diagnostic Data RDR Enabler Remote Diagnostic Request is the functionality developed as part of the B2 feature delivery that can be used to trigger various diagnostic service requests from the cloud to the vehicle via a Telematics Control Unit for any Electronic Communication Unit ECU over the Controlled Area Network CAN bus The B2 design will be incorporated to be part of the larger CVDA enabler and AVD feature capability in B4 introducing more rigor in the structure and the formatting of the request PARSED Enabler Processing and Reporting System for Efficient Dataupload PARSED provides a unified system for accessing vehicle ECU deep data that is not currently accessible via the vehicle network Due to current vehicle network bandwidth limitations some level of data compression is necessary to provide the fidelity of information while maintaining bus utilization requirements for the vehicle PARSED is intended to Provide an aggregation structure and transmission method for internal software variables that are located in the software of an ECU that might not be transmitted on the vehicle bus Aggregate already available data into smaller data structures to be transmitted over high cost data transmission methodologies at a reduced cost without sacrificing data integrity Provide a unified
