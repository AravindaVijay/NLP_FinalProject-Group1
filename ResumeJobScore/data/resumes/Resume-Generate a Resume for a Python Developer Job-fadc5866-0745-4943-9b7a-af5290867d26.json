consumer applications to receive realtime events from billers The platform guarantees order of event delivery along with an atleast once message delivery paradigm BEP interfaces with CSG billing systems to process change events as they are applied in the biller and to produce a common and enriched event output for subscribers who wish to consume those changes Eventing as a Service EaaS EaaS is an eventing streaming pipeline that would enable consumers to get data from various sources and have their data sent to a destinations of their choice During the transportation process the consumer would also be able to apply filter rules and enrich the payload data The producer will have the ability to create schemas with applied versioning and notify the consumers of their data specifications
