Project IFACT 0318 to Present Description Our team are developing a software for welding inspection real time for robotic visual system which will be used to determine whether the weld is of suitable quality for its intended application Responsibilities Designed a noisy filter algorithm to remove noisy data from outer layer and smooth the edge for 3D point cloud obtained from robotic visual system by using C Visualized 3D point cloud Data and did simple cloud data operation like subtraction computer cloud to cloud distance with Cloud Compare Converted 3D point cloud data to RGB images for welding classification using C Used TensorFlow framework to implement convolutional neural network to do welding bead type classification with Python Analyzed and worked with all aspects of regression
