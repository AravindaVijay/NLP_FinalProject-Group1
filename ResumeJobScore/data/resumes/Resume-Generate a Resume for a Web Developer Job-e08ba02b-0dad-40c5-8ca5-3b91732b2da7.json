Confluence It has almost all the features which a spreadsheet software may offer with few additional features like import a workbook and export your Confluence Excellentable data as PDF Excel HTML or CSV files User can also share a Excellentable with other use and apply column filter and global filter to show only intended rows It also provides a way to see the edit history of a workbook and restore to one of the previous versions Added multiple features to the plugin few of them are REST APIs Versioning Share Excellentable with other users Import and Export The plugin at the core is using Webwork framework to create actions Jersey to write REST APIs and Active Objects for data persistence The plugin have few listeners to keep an eye on Confluence pagetemplate created and updated

EXTENDED SEARCH PLUGIN Confluence Plugin This app enhance the Confluence search by adding external content third party application within Confluence and redirecting user to see the whole content if user clicks on the search result The app also provides synonym search which brings search results based on the synonyms to the original search term The synonyms can be defined in the admin screen of the app Created requirement document and convert into stories Created mockups to depict how the plugin admin screen will appear Created a module to update Lucene search index every time a user createsupdates a page Created admin screen where user can define synonyms and persist them using active object Exposed a REST API which can be consumed by third party application to send the data to be indexed at Confluence level by the plugin by introducing custom content type Enhanced the Confluence search abilities to detect the external content being added and show in the search result Wrote a scheduler which cleans the external content after its expiry date SEARCH ANALYTICS PLUGIN Confluence plugin A search analytics plugin which captures all the search being done in a Confluence instance and creates reports The global report can be seen by Confluence admin only and theres another report which is generated on Space level which can be seen as per permission set on the admin screen provided by the app Created requirement document and convert into stories Created mockups to depict how the search report will appear to the customer Created a macro which shows search report
