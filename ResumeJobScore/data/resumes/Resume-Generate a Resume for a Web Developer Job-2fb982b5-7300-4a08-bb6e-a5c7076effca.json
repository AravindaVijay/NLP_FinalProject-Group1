Reduce HDFS AWS and developed multiple MapReduce jobs in PIG and Hive for data cleaning and preprocessing Manage datasets using Panda data frames and MySQL queried MYSQL database queries from python using PythonMySQL connector and MySQL dB package to retrieve information Involved in the WebApplication development using Python 35 HTML5 CSS3 AJAX JSON and jQuery Develop and tested many features for dashboard using Python Java Bootstrap CSS JavaScript and jQuery Generated Python Django forms to record data of online users and used PyTest for writing test cases Implemented and modified various SQL queries and Functions Cursors and Triggers as per the client requirements Clean data and processed thirdparty spending data into maneuverable deliverables within specific format with Excel macros and python libraries such as NumPy SQL Alchemy and matplotlib Used Pandas as API to put the data as time series and tabular format for manipulation and retrieval of data Helped with the migration from the old server to Jira database Matching Fields with Python scripts for transferring and verifying the information Analyze Format data using Machine Learning algorithm by Python ScikitLearn Experience in python Jupyter Scientific computing stack NumPy SciPy pandas and matplotlib Perform troubleshooting fixed and deployed many Python bug fixes of the two main applications that were a main source of
