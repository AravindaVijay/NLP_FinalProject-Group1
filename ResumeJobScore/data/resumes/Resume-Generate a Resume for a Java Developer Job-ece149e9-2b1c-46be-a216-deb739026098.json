of hospital easily This application was developed to provide better service to the customers and helpful to the hospitals maintaining individual patients life time medical record doctor details investigation The records can be accessed anytime anywhere instantly with recently updated information of all the patients particularly ICU patients Responsibilities Involved in various Software Development Life Cycle SDLC phases of the project using Agilemethodology Used various Core Java concepts such as multithreading exception handling collection APIs to implement various features and enhancements Extensively worked on business front end and persistence tier using the JSP Servlets Spring MVC and JSON Used design patterns like Front controller DTO Singleton Facade Factory design patterns Developed Hibernate framework for back end development and Spring Dependency Injection for middle layer development Involved in design development and implementation of front end part of the

some custom directives to do some reusable component Maintained Cross Browser compatibility implement Responsive Web Design using Twitter Bootstrap and custom media queries Developed CSS styles to maintain the uniformity of all the screens throughout the application and positioning of screen objects Made AJAX calls using Backbonejs to get data parsing it for showing on webpage Successfully handled JSONXML data and carried out JSONXML parsing for form submissions andDOM manipulation Created REST web services consumed it using Angular to communicate between apps Performed form validations using reactive forms for sign in and inputting ticket rising information from Angular framework Created tables and worked on SQL and PLSQL to write Stored Procedures functions and packages for complex Inserts and updates in the database Worked on development of Hibernate including mapping files configuration file and classes to interact with the database Worked with Hibernate Query Language HQL to
