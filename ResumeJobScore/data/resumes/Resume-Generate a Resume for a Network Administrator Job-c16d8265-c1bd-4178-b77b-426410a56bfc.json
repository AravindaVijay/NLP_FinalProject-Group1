Oracle SQL server MySQL Environment JSP SERVLETS Oracle 9i SQL Server MS Access MySQL Catching Packet Droppers and Modifiers In Wireless Sensor Networks Undergraduate ProjectJNTU Final year Packet dropping and modification are common attacks that can be launched by an adversary to disrupt communication in wireless multi hop sensor networks Many schemes have been proposed to mitigate or tolerate such attacks but very few can effectively and efficiently identify the intruders To address this problem we propose a simple yet effective scheme which can identify misbehaving forwarders that drop or
