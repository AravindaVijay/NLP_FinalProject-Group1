Description Clustering algorithms are used to group data so that the objects in each cluster are more similar to those in the same group visvis to those of another group Role Creating a system using Java for comparing 3 types of clustering algorithms on a dataset Applying Kmeans DBSCAN and Agglomerative and Divisive Hierarchical algorithms to a dataset Graphical representation of each step in the clustering techniques Calculating time and space complexities Finding the best fit clustering algorithm for the particular dataset Writing a detailed report with the program findings highlighting the advantages and disadvantages associated with each algorithm Software Programmer AGL Technologies January 2004 to November 2006 Worked on software in VB that deals with all the stages of booking an
