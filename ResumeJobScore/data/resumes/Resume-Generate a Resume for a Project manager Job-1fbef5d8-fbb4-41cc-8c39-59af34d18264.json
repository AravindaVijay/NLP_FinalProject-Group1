as the team point of contact for new containersasaservice project learning to support the environment as well as training team members Obtained insight into the administration and deployment of the CI tool Concourse and Terraform which is utilized to deploy the EC2 instances and Helm to deploy Concourse to the Kubernetes environment Efforts accelerated the speed of deployment through testing environments from days to just hours Delivered training resulting in costs savings and preventing the company from having to host onsite training Executed the adoption of a new Continuous Delivery tool Urban Code Deploy which retired the old tool set and new standards for deploying code to environments and assimilated DevOps on a large scale within the organization Implemented templates for stability reducing incident tickets from failed deployments to near zero Created Windows specific deployment templates for UrbanCode that deployed MSI and NUPKG applications including web applications that utilize IIS Generated a library of training videos to facilitate selfservice training for users of UrbanCode Performed testing for an UrbanCode plugin to install Guidewire applications in WebSphere CoAuthored Python application that checked for the presence of FISMA regulated users within RocketChat and created notifications of pending deactivations to maintain compliance Collaborated with Team POC for proofofconcept work with EC2DockerEEKubernetes using Terraform and Helm built a custom Kubernetes cluster specifically to address security concerns regarding ConcourseCI Troubleshot to fix issues with ConcourseCI New Relic event emitter incorporating metrics from KubeStateMetrics for nearreal time view of cluster performance Coordinated efforts with internal and external auditors providing reports and demonstrations of tools their administration and security procedures used to prevent unauthorized access Delivered proofofconcept to auditors on tools to ensure capability of meeting auditing SOC 12 Partnered with application area to convert existing Grails application build from Maven 2 eventually settling on Gradle as a build solution Engineered custom solutions for a business area that used Filenet to share resources between on premise and remote development area Provided training and support to team members for Kubernetes Docker Helm and Terraform Administrated

availability managed users in LDAP and Active Directory Addressed alerts in Novel Operations Center and assisted application owners in troubleshooting system issues Authored technical documentation and trained both new associates and new project members Built and configured new systems as part of several refresh projects RHEL 62 and Windows 2008 R2 Migrated virtual servers to the disaster recovery environment and worked with application owners and network technicians to troubleshoot any issues as they arose Automated auditing and administration tasks via Powershell or Bash scripts Created or fixed routine and custom jobs in BMC BladeLogic to aid in the automation of various tasks including automated system auditing and core tool set installation Implemented a process to address the manual audit with a nearly 10 failure rate both false positive and false negative and an average time to complete manual audit of 18 hours per server Developed a Powershell script that would mount selected registry hives and set the correct secure value for more than 100 registry keys Completed the audit of all registry entries in less than a minute as opposed to the 4 5 hours it previously took Reduced the risk of potentially changing a value within registry that could damage the system Utilized Bash scripts for Linux servers that automated some of the audit checks and dramatically reduced the overall time to complete and audit as well as establish a standard format for the files on the servers Skills Docker Jenkins Python Websphere Network operations Migrations Linux Training
