external interfaces in order to exchange the data in different forms by using RESTful service Established Database Connectivity using JDBC Hibernate OR mapping with Spring ORM for Oracle Packaged and deployed the application in IBM Web Sphere Written LINUX shell scripts to identify user login information Used Maven tools for building and deploying the Web applications Implemented JUNIT test cases for unit testing and Suites for end to end testing Used JIRA for tracking the Project Stories and used SVN as version control tool Developed enhancements to MongoDB architecture to improve performance and scalability Environment Java J2EE HTML CSS JQuery JavaScript Angular JS JSON XML Spring MVC Hibernate RESTful HQL SQL IBM Web Sphere Application Server Oracle JMS JNDI Maven UML JIRA Tortoise SVN LINUX Java Developer Capgemini June 2012 to August 2013 Responsibilities Use Struts and JavaScript for web page development and frontend validations Fetch and process customer related data using Mercator IBM WTX as interface between Apollo workstation with Mainframes Created Servlets JSPs and used JUnit framework for unit testing Developed EJBs DAOs Stored Procedures and SQL queries to support system functionality Application design and documentation UML system use cases class sequence diagrams developed using MS Visio Extensively used XML documents with XSLT and CSS to translate it to HTML to present to GUI Developed Session beans for functionality as per the requirement Used Spring MVC framework for implementing the Web tier of the application Used Hibernate API to perform database operations Used Design patterns like MVC pattern DAO pattern and singleton to achieve clean separation of layers Use Ant scripts to automate application build and deployment processes Support
