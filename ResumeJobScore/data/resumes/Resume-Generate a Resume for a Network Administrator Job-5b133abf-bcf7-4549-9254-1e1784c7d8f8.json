test cell is adapted for both making and testing samples The cell includes a bottom plate and a top plate having concentric apertures defining a central test cavity A post attached to the bottom plate closes off the bottom of the test cavity A slide closes off the top of the test cavity The top of the post is spaced slightly from the underside of the slide to define a test cavity of substantially uniform thickness The test cavity is filled with phosphor suspended in uncured resin closed and the resin is cured Once cured the sample is stable although delicate and can be remeasured several times with reproducible results The measurement takes place in the cell using a thin film of oil for wetting surfaces Publications Detecting Parameter Changes Using Experimental Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos httpsvibrationacousticsasmedigitalcollectionasmeorgarticleaspxarticleid1469768 199607 A method of detecting parameter changes using analytical and experimental nonlinear dynamics and chaos is applied to a piecewiselinear oscillator Experimental data show the chaotic nature of the system through phase portraits Poincar maps frequency spectra and bifurcation diagrams Unstable periodic orbits were extracted from each chaotic time series obtained from the system with six different parameter values Movement of the unstable periodic orbits in phase space is used to detect parameter changes in the
