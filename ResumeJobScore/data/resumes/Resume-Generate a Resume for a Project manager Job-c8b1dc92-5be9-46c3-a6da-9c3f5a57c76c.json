to order food online and to be delivered at residence or business Food Crave has an mobile as well as an web application The custom application has many features like the restaurant login customer login Delivery driver modules and the Admin logins Designed front end and backend of the admin application using Python on Django Web Framework Responsible for all issues and enhancements of the Admin module Used HTML CSS AJAX JSON designed and developed the user interface of the website Worked on AngularJS for the client facing application Developed views and templates with Django view controller and template Language to create a userfriendly website interface Create a Docker images and save into registery containers and Docker consoles for managing the application life cycle Deployed and managed a private puppet infrastructure in AWS to deploy application Increased the speed of preexisting search indexes through DJango ORM optimizations Developed a module to build Django ORM queries that can preload data to greatly reduce the number of databases queries needed to retrieve the same amount of data Python app which analyzed activity and response times code deployment and environment migration done in Amazon AWS Quick access to Amazon API Rendered Dashboard which provided important milestone Metrics Reduced the release cycle overhead by half Developed Restful micro services using Djangoand Python and deployed on Heroku server Deployed and managed a private puppet infrastructure in AWS to deploy application Worked extensively on the Frontend with Bootstrap JavaScript and JQuery to optimize the user experience Developed RESTful services using Python Used GIT version control and deployed project to Heroku Worked on the client facing AngularJs application Used GIT version
