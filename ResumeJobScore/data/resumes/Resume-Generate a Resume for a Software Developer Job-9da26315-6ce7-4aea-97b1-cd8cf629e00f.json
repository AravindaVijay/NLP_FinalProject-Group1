PMO which is currently managed on a SharePoint site Grim The obligatory trade reporting of UK Gilts to London Stock Exchange is handled by an application called Grim within the Deutsche Bank infrastructure which receives the trade data from Trade Manager The objective of the project is to define the business and legal requirements on UK Gilts primary market deals which need to be excluded from the Gilt trade reporting to the London Stock Exchange through the GRIM application The reporting should exclude all primary market deals done the 1st tranche of a new issue or any other following tranches tap as well as our purchases between Deutsche Bank and other market makers since only the seller is obliged to report to London Stock Exchange The existing logic in GRIM filters the above mentioned trades insufficiently and causes complaints addressed by the London Stock exchange to Deutsche Banks compliance team creating the risk of fines being imposed by the regulator Further to the suppression of primary market deals trades with low trading volume should be reported The current logic in GRIM is rounding down to zero and suppressing the trade reporting which causes an

Oracle Toad Windows NT iPlanet Web Server Sublime Order processing system is a complex software application which dealt with creation of Ordersplacing the orders for the customers of ATT with respect to the products or services provided by ATT This involved interfacing with lots of external systems for Billing Provisioning Status tracking etc The front end part which implies the UI using which the order is placed takes lots of processing after the order is placed by customer like Order Decomposition where we decompose the Order and send it to appropriate systems for processing it Ex Billing Provisioning etc This part of order decomposition is the centralized part of the whole application where all the processing starts from here Interfacing with other systems was done using XML over HTTP This was the basic way of communication where in we used to send XML request with respect to the business details which has to be sent to that system and wait for a response from it Here there was a concept of synchronous and asynchronous where the response could be any of these based on the system which is processing it From architecture point of view we had followed Model View Controller MVC architecture But ATT had their own implementation of this Contribution and Responsibilities Client interaction for handling the requirements and development issues also including discussions on
