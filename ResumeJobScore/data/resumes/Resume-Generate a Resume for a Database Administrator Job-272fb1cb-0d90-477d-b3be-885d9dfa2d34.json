technical solution Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Java Developer MasterCard OFallon MO January 2017 to Present Description Crossborder batch disbursement supports high volume customers as a part of expanding the service to support flows like P2P B2B G2C etc MC customers are requesting batch file processing capabilities because their business model is more aligned to sending many requests at one time and at scheduled or periodic times Batch is the best mechanism to support this business need but this is not a service that is provided as part of the current offering The benefit of adding this capability is that it allows us to offer our services to a larger spectrum of potential customers Larger potentially more profitable customers send high volumes of transactions during specific or scheduled times Smaller potentially less profitable but still viable may not want or be able to support the backend interfaces that are required for API

members writing the reports and test documentation Strong communication skills and ability to work effectively with technical teammates in order to translate business requirements to an effective technical solution Authorized to work in the US for any employer Work Experience Senior Java Developer MasterCard OFallon MO January 2017 to Present Description Crossborder batch disbursement supports high volume customers as a part of expanding the service to support flows like P2P B2B G2C etc MC customers are requesting batch file processing capabilities because their business model is more aligned to sending many requests at one time and at scheduled or periodic times Batch is the best mechanism to support this business need but this is not a service that is provided as part of the current offering The benefit of adding this capability is that it allows us to offer our services to a larger spectrum of potential customers Larger potentially more profitable customers send high volumes of transactions during specific or scheduled times Smaller potentially less profitable but still viable may not want or be able to support the backend interfaces that are required for API integration and single realtime payments This initiative is global in nature as it will not be used for a specific customer or region Environment Java 18 Spring JDBC Spring DI Apache Camel DSL JAXB
