Apparition Crowdsourced User Interfaces That Come To Life As You Sketch Them httpshcistanfordedupublications2015apparitionapparitionCHI2015pdf 201510 Prototyping allows designers to quickly iterate and gather feedback but the time it takes to create even a WizardofOz prototype reduces the utility of the process In this paper we introduce crowdsourcing techniques and tools for prototyping interactive systems in the time it takes to describe the idea Our Apparition system uses paid microtask crowds to make even hardtoautomate functions work immediately allowing more fluid prototyping of interfaces that contain interactive elements and complex behaviors As users sketch their inter face and describe it aloud in natural language crowd work ers and sketch recognition algorithms translate the input into user interface elements add animations and provide Wizard ofOz functionality We discuss how design teams can use our approach to reflect on prototypes or begin user studies within seconds and how over time Apparition prototypes can become fullyimplemented versions of the systems they simulate Powering Apparition is the first selfcoordinated realtime crowdsourcing infrastructure We anchor this in frastructure on a new lightweight writelocking mechanism that workers can use to signal their intentions to each other",

httpshcistanfordedupublications2015apparitionapparitionCHI2015pdf 201510 Prototyping allows designers to quickly iterate and gather feedback but the time it takes to create even a WizardofOz prototype reduces the utility of the process In this paper we introduce crowdsourcing techniques and tools for prototyping interactive systems in the time it takes to describe the idea Our Apparition system uses paid microtask crowds to make even hardtoautomate functions work immediately allowing more fluid prototyping of interfaces that contain interactive elements and complex behaviors As users sketch their inter face and describe it aloud in natural language crowd work ers and sketch recognition algorithms translate the input into user interface elements add animations and provide Wizard ofOz functionality We discuss how design teams can use our approach to reflect on prototypes or begin user studies within seconds and how over time Apparition prototypes can become fullyimplemented versions of the systems they simulate Powering Apparition is the first selfcoordinated realtime crowdsourcing infrastructure We anchor this in frastructure on a new lightweight writelocking mechanism that workers can use to signal their intentions to each other",
