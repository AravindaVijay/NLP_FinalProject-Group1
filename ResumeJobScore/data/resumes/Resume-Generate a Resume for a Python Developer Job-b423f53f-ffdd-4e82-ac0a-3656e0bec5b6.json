Basic and Visual Studio Participated and lead in all phases of the software development lifecycle including requirements design coding and testing in a team work environment Built the Student Management System user interface using Visual Basic within Visual Studio following application architecture UI requirements defined by many existing systems Applied a systematic approach to create the design characteristics of software components based upon analysis of requirements and technical direction provided by professor of Software Engineering Implemented tested and debugged SIMS software to conform to requirements and design which included the use of storing data in a server Wrote the server connection and queries in Visual Basic and passed them through the MySQL libraries as strings Managed student data in MySQL and was able to directly manipulate data using the Student Management System application with full input and output from server side Collaborated with team members to accomplish common goals ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION ACO DATA STRUCTURE IN C Lead programmer in class project for Data Structures Class using C and Visual Studio Implemented tested and debugged ACO algorithm to conform to design requirements Resulted in a smoother running algorithm that used 3 less memory in the beginning steps of development Demonstrated the special data structure Ant Colony Optimization on how it is a great probalistic technique in finding the shortest path between several points on a graph similar to the way ants find the shortest path between several food source and the ant colony base Resulted in a better understanding from audience and allowed them to ask more specific questions Compared ACO to Nearest Neighbor and Swarm Optimization data structures to show close to optimum solutions Professor of data structure course agreed that ACO is more optimal in certain cases involving starting point and several other points on a graph Understood the data architecture of the ACO data structure and relayed the information in a class presentation which was constructed using Binary Trees in a recursive function This allowed the algorithm to operate at its maximum potential and prevent overloading the Windows 7 system memory Jan 17 May 17 Sep 16 Dec 16",

abdomar528wixsitecomportfolio 8324061921 abdomar528gmailcom US Citizen STUDENT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM SIMS IN VISUAL BASIC Lead developer in class project for Software Engineering Class using Visual Basic and Visual Studio Participated and lead in all phases of the software development lifecycle including requirements design coding and testing in a team work environment Built the Student Management System user interface using Visual Basic within Visual Studio following application architecture UI requirements defined by many existing systems Applied a systematic approach to create the design characteristics of software components based upon analysis of requirements and technical direction provided by professor of Software Engineering Implemented tested and debugged SIMS software to conform to requirements and design which included the use of storing data in a server Wrote the server connection and queries in Visual Basic and passed them through the MySQL libraries as strings Managed student data in MySQL and was able to directly manipulate data using the Student Management System application with full input and output from server side Collaborated with team members to accomplish common goals ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION ACO DATA STRUCTURE IN C Lead programmer in class project for Data Structures Class using C and Visual Studio Implemented tested and debugged ACO algorithm to conform to design requirements Resulted in a smoother running algorithm that used 3 less memory in the beginning steps of development Demonstrated the special data structure Ant Colony Optimization on how it is a great probalistic technique in finding the shortest path between several points on a graph similar to the way ants find the shortest path between several food source and the ant colony base Resulted in a better understanding from audience and allowed them to ask more specific questions Compared ACO to Nearest Neighbor and Swarm Optimization data structures to show close to optimum solutions Professor of data structure course agreed that ACO is more optimal in certain cases involving starting point and several other points on a graph Understood the data architecture of the ACO data structure and relayed the information in a class presentation which was constructed using Binary Trees in a recursive function This allowed the algorithm to operate at its maximum potential and prevent overloading the Windows 7 system memory Jan 17 May 17 Sep 16 Dec 16",
