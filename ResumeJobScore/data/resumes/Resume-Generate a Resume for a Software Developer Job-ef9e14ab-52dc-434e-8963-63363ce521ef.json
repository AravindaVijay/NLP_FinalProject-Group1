Angular Core Java ANT MAVEN AJAX CSS Oracle WebLogic UNIX MySQL JUnit Agile Eclipse IDE Academic Project Project Calculating the similarity between two strings using Jaccard Distance for a web application January 2017May 2017 Technology Java HTML JavaScript Description A string similarity measure quantifies the similarity between two text strings for approximate string matching or comparison Most existing work that computes the similarity of two strings only consider syntactic similarities eg number of common words or qgrams While this is indeed an indicator of similarity there are many important cases where syntactically different strings can represent the same realworld object The purpose of this project is to evaluate string similarity measures efficiently and perform joins thereby boosting the quality of string matching Education Bachelors of Engineering in Engineering and Technology Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Masters in Computer Science in Computer

Angular Core Java ANT MAVEN AJAX CSS Oracle WebLogic UNIX MySQL JUnit Agile Eclipse IDE Academic Project Project Calculating the similarity between two strings using Jaccard Distance for a web application January 2017May 2017 Technology Java HTML JavaScript Description A string similarity measure quantifies the similarity between two text strings for approximate string matching or comparison Most existing work that computes the similarity of two strings only consider syntactic similarities eg number of common words or qgrams While this is indeed an indicator of similarity there are many important cases where syntactically different strings can represent the same realworld object The purpose of this project is to evaluate string similarity measures efficiently and perform joins thereby boosting the quality of string matching Education Bachelors of Engineering in Engineering and Technology Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Masters in Computer Science in Computer
