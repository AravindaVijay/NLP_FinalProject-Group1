used the application to generate purchase order and sales order when items are purchased from different vendors The purchase order and Sales Order screens are designed using Angular JS Spring MVC I work on the web page development and maintenance The application is deployed in Websphere Application Server and the back end database is DB2 I write MAVEN script for code build and deployment Customer has various data sources and external systems from where they get different files Some of these files are structured data CSV and some are semistructured in the form of JSON The semistructured data are feedback data coming from different social media channels like Facebook Twitter etc These files are loaded in our AWS S3 Bucket and they are loaded once every day using AWS Lambda function Once files are loaded we get notification The files are downloaded and we run our custom JAVA class to parse those files We use Java file handling API to parse the CSV and extract the data and store them in MS SQL DB These CSVs are transaction records for each day For the JSON data we use Google GSON API to extract and load them to MS SQL DB Once the tables are loaded we run queries on top of it for analytical processing I used to connect Tableau with MS SQL DB for reporting and dashboard generation The output of some queries are extracted and loaded back to AWS S3 bucket

used the application to generate purchase order and sales order when items are purchased from different vendors The purchase order and Sales Order screens are designed using Angular JS Spring MVC I work on the web page development and maintenance The application is deployed in Websphere Application Server and the back end database is DB2 I write MAVEN script for code build and deployment Customer has various data sources and external systems from where they get different files Some of these files are structured data CSV and some are semistructured in the form of JSON The semistructured data are feedback data coming from different social media channels like Facebook Twitter etc These files are loaded in our AWS S3 Bucket and they are loaded once every day using AWS Lambda function Once files are loaded we get notification The files are downloaded and we run our custom JAVA class to parse those files We use Java file handling API to parse the CSV and extract the data and store them in MS SQL DB These CSVs are transaction records for each day For the JSON data we use Google GSON API to extract and load them to MS SQL DB Once the tables are loaded we run queries on top of it for analytical processing I used to connect Tableau with MS SQL DB for reporting and dashboard generation The output of some queries are extracted and loaded back to AWS S3 bucket
