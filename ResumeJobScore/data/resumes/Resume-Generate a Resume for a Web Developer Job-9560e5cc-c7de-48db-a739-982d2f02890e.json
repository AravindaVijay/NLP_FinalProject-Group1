Created and configured elastic load balancers and auto scaling groups to distribute the traffic and to have a cost efficient fault tolerant and highly available environment Created S3 buckets in the AWS environment to store files sometimes which are required to serve static content for a web application Used AWS Beanstalk for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java Configured S3 buckets with various life cycle policies to archive the infrequently accessed data to storage classes based on requirement Implemented domain name service DNS through route 53 to have highly available and scalable applications Maintained the monitoring and alerting of production and corporate servers using CloudWatch service Created EBS volumes for storing application files for use with EC2 instances whenever they are mounted to them Experienced in creating RDS instances to serve data through servers for responding to requests Created snapshots to take backups of the volumes and also images to store launch configurations of the EC2 instances Implemented and maintained the monitoring and alerting of production and corporate serversstorage using Cloud Watch Experience in Configuring and deploying micro services on cloud leveraging high scalability and high availability design patterns Effectively involved in configuring and implementing of composite Network models
