    "clean_data": "DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING Executive Profile Proactive engineer with years of experience and management skills in Operation Management and Industrial Engineering with a passion to increase operational performance and improving customer s satisfaction With responsibility that have crossed all levels of managerial responsibilities including but not exclusive OHSA EPA and logistic requirements inventory and WIP control budgetary generation which increases my abilities to be proactive in ensuring customer satisfaction With managerial responsibilities in managing plant operation engineering departments and developing diverse team members to achieve success I recently achieved my Masters in Business Administration and presently working on my Six Sigma certification which provides me additional skills to pursue my passion I am an individual with extensive experience in the operational and managerial elements it takes to optimizing a production operation while control cost and its relationship to financial effect on the organization Striving to improve operational methodology and operational sequences to reduce product cost Studying operational ergonomics in efforts to eliminate or control worked relate injuries business operation and project management in all aspect of an industrial operation My experience also includes inventory control methods such as JIT as well as lean manufacturing practices that are required to develop an effective operational continuous improvement process to achieve the desired goals I excel in the ability of combining diverse backgrounds of different individual into one common direction of accomplishment creating an atmosphere of trust and teamwork Skill Highlights Product development Product line expansion Project Management Budgeting expertise Quality Management Distribution Management Facility Management MBA Time Management Studies Total quality management Work flow Planning Staff Development Staff Motivation Expense ControlInventory Control Labor Cost Controls Negotiation Skills Core Accomplishments Project Management Implemented a monitoring project reporting project comparing projected project cost to actual project cost with the purpose to provide management information concerning effect on projected margins This resulted in margins increasing from 3 average to 18 average Successful developed and Implemented an inventory control software that reduced yearly expenditures by 500 000 and on hand inventory by 750 000 Reorganized finishing and distribution operation into a team group operation which resulted in decrease in cost by 20 30 Professional Experience Director of Engineering Jun 2013 to Jul 2014 Company Name City State Management of a staff of engineers performing PRE COST COSTING

AUTO CAD pattern development Costing Manager Apr 2003 to Dec 2009 Company Name City State With major responsible was establishing the bill of material structure including direct labor hour calculation from CAD drawing and motion time analysis to determine the different level of cost factors in the manufacturing process With extensive experience in the analysis of the production process to determine actual cost I was able to generate monitoring devise to report activity concerning margin fluctuation Experience in developing and operating systems to monitoring and establish material with usage of a MRP system I also developed project progress reporting comparing projected project cost to actual project cost to monitor and provide management information of progress effect on project margins This included electrical components steel fabricated component and tooled components based of Cad draws and regulator standards Proposed and implemented lean manufacturing techniques and continuous improvement manufacturing concepts training to improve turns and reduce manufacturing cost Also imitated a 500 000 interest free loan from the rural development community to provide capital for expansion in production capacity As a result the cost control and reporting margins increased from 3 average to 18 average Chief Industrial Engineer Manager of R D Jan 1991 to Dec 2002 Company Name

engineering departments and developing diverse team members to achieve success I recently achieved my Masters in Business Administration and presently working on my Six Sigma certification which provides me additional skills to pursue my passion I am an individual with extensive experience in the operational and managerial elements it takes to optimizing a production operation while control cost and its relationship to financial effect on the organization Striving to improve operational methodology and operational sequences to reduce product cost Studying operational ergonomics in efforts to eliminate or control worked relate injuries business operation and project management in all aspect of an industrial operation My experience also includes inventory control methods such as JIT as well as lean manufacturing practices that are required to develop an effective operational continuous improvement process to achieve the desired goals I excel in the ability of combining diverse backgrounds of different individual into one common direction of accomplishment creating an atmosphere of trust and teamwork Skill Highlights Product development Product line expansion Project Management Budgeting expertise Quality Management Distribution Management Facility Management MBA Time Management Studies Total quality management Work flow Planning Staff Development Staff Motivation Expense ControlInventory Control Labor Cost Controls Negotiation Skills Core Accomplishments Project Management Implemented a monitoring project reporting project comparing projected project cost to actual project cost with the purpose to provide management information concerning effect on projected margins This resulted in margins increasing from 3 average to 18 average Successful developed and Implemented an inventory control software that reduced yearly expenditures by 500 000 and on hand inventory by 750 000 Reorganized finishing and distribution operation into a team group operation
