created a C CSV SQLServer Transformer with a WCF Service Library that can service Windows or Web Forms Lets say a person can designspecify a Data Warehouse by simply exporting a group of views as CSV into one file folder Big Picture My automation automatically creates the Data Warehouse transforms and transports the data from the CSV folder shown above Details My automation can allow a user to create and point to Database Schemas where the CSV data will be transformed and transported My SchemaTable focused stored procedures do all of the database work except for the dynamic CREATE TABLE SQL building easier to debug in C My automation loops thru the CSV folder with CSV files as shown above to Compress all eg TimeDetail files shown above data into one database table Dump each files CSV data into a dynamically created matching temporary all VarChar temp table in SQL Server Automatically scan all the data rows to automatically determine the nonVarChar columns ie bit int long float

    "experience": "Experience C VBNET SQL Server ERWin API Developer JP Morgan Chase Wilmington DE March 217 to Present Took ownership of a C VBNET   application that uses the COM ERWin API to read ERWin Models into a SQL Server 212 database The application produces various reports that standardize the workflow analysis and reporting of ERWin Model Status across database development teams Produced many new SQL C VBNET   Console application features Subversion Interface for Users to unzip load Erwin Models from SVN URIs Loaded new data from a new tree node in the ERWin APIs data store Moved SQL to stored procedures to boost performance Changed and created new Excel Automation Mitigated COM Object cleanup problems to reduce memory leaks Consumed Ab Initio web services to transform XML to CSV databases Designed the SQL Server database and wrote the C to parse Oracle View SQL into the database tables used by downstream folks for Lineage Analysis Wrote complex SQL Server stored procedures that accept ADONET DataTable arguments via userdefined database table types C VBNET SQL Server SSRS Developer Weyandt LLC August 216 to January 217 Created VS215 with DevExpress VS213 SSRS and SSMS 216 for SQL Server Azure 212 software development environments Revised an SSRS report and associated SQL Revised   to layer in Facility I d handling Created a new MDI Winforms Project with User Controls Create a new NET console application to extract transform and load ETL JSON file data into legacy and new SQL Server tables Created new NET Middleware and SQL Server Database tables indexes foreign keys and stored procedures to persist the new JSON data Coded blocks of stored procedure calls SqlBulkCopy database work in NET transactions Figured out how to pass a long NET DataTable to a stored procedure with a SQL Server User Defined Table Type parameter Created the NET template class hierarchy for the JSON structures so that each JSON file can be deserialized into the class hierarchy via one VBNET statement Created new JSON Schema files and NET code to validate the JSON Data C SQL Server Developer Weyandt LLC October 216 to December 216 12 hours total I created a C CSV SQLServer Transformer with a WCF Service Library that can service Windows or Web Forms Lets say a person can designspecify a Data Warehouse by simply exporting a group of views as CSV into one file folder Big Picture My automation automatically creates the Data Warehouse transforms and transports the data from the CSV folder shown above Details My automation can allow a user to create and point to Database Schemas where the CSV data will be transformed and transported My SchemaTable focused stored procedures do all of the database work except for the dynamic CREATE TABLE SQL building easier to debug in C My automation loops thru the CSV folder with CSV files as shown above to Compress all eg TimeDetail files shown above data into one database table Dump each files CSV data into a dynamically created matching temporary all VarChar temp table in SQL Server Automatically scan all the data rows to automatically determine the nonVarChar columns ie bit int long float date etc Dynamically build execute CREATE TABLE SQL to create each Typed database table like this dynamically build and execute INSERT INTO SELECT statements to transform and transport the CSV Data into the Typed Tables with TRY_CAST Columns like this C InterSystems Cache Database SSRS Developer Radius Global Solutions Ambler PA April 216 to June 216 Created two new SSRS reports and associated SQL that 1 ODBC connect to InterSystems Cache databases used by Artiva CRM with multiple parameters via hardwired or database driven values 2 Deliver default and multiselectable visible or not report columns Created a new C console application framework with reusable classes and interfaces that performs four major functions 1 Creates an HTML formatted SMTP email report from a combination of Windows folder Disk statistics and a stats file downloaded from Linux 2 Creates an email report from an ADONET DataTable converted to CSV and attached to the email 3 Reads an Excel XLSX file into ADONET DataTables converted to multiple CSVs attached to the email 4 Downloads 3 large zipped files from Linux unzips the files parses files into multiple files for different record types and chunks large files into smaller files based on configurable file sizes and record counts and uploads the small files to Linux SQL Server Oracle Vertica Python Developer HighPoint Solutions East Norriton PA July 215 to January 216 I reengineered the HighPoint Solutions DataBurst data warehousing software product into Python to fit into Teva Pharmaceuticals Vertica database environment From scratch I wrote all of the

Python SQL components Python for Cleaning Raw Tables Python for Integrating Cleansed Tables Python Workflow Engine for running SQL Blocks Python Blocks and parentchild Workflow Blocks Created a convention of configuration tables for reuse in any ODBC compliant target client database The Python uses SQL Templates and dynamically assembles SQL then executes the SQL to transform data Raw Data Cleansed Data Integration Data DataMart Data I wrote a lot of Python Python PYODBC SQL cursors and transactions Python job and SQL statement logging with performance analytics Python trycatch

Figured out how to pass a long NET DataTable to a stored procedure with a SQL Server User Defined Table Type parameter Created the NET template class hierarchy for the JSON structures so that each JSON file can be deserialized into the class hierarchy via one VBNET statement Created new JSON Schema files and NET code to validate the JSON Data C SQL Server Developer Weyandt LLC October 2016 to December 2016 120 hours total I created a C CSV SQLServer Transformer with a WCF Service Library that can service Windows or Web Forms Lets say a person can designspecify a Data Warehouse by simply exporting a group of views as CSV into one file folder Big Picture My automation automatically creates the Data Warehouse transforms and transports the data from the CSV folder shown above Details My automation can allow a user to create and point to Database Schemas where the CSV data will be transformed and transported My SchemaTable focused stored procedures do all of the database work except for the dynamic CREATE TABLE SQL building easier to debug in C My automation loops thru the CSV folder with CSV files as shown above to Compress all eg TimeDetail files shown above data into one database table Dump each files CSV data into a dynamically created matching temporary all VarChar temp table in SQL Server Automatically scan all the data rows to automatically determine the nonVarChar columns ie bit int long float date etc Dynamically build execute CREATE TABLE SQL to create each Typed database table like this dynamically build and execute INSERT INTO SELECT statements
