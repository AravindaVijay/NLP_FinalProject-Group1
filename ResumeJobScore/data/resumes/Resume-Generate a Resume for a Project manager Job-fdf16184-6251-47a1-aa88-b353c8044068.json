DEPOT September 2012 to July 2015 Description The existing Order management system that the client used can process the orders created by the customer at that particular store Centralization of accessing all these orders among different stores is not possible with the existing application Enhanced Special Services COM was launched to convert the existing business processes to process orders created across different stores Orders created in one store can be processed at different stores In addition enhancements like integration with third party vendor accessing central customer data printing reports in PDF etc were done along with the core releases In this release we will interact with Sterling product from IBM to process orders Sterling is the core database to save the order related information Customer Order Management COM acts as an interface between ESVS and Sterling application Responsibilities Worked on complete life cycle design development and testing using OOA and OOD Created technical design documents from the existing ESVS application in Java and BRS for critical business processes This involves creating XSDs for the Restful services writing pseudo code and creating UML diagrams Developed user interfaces using Adobe Flex 40 using Cairngorm framework Developed REST based Web Services using JAXB and JSON and SOAP Services Implemented Different Design patterns like singleton factory and Dependency Injection Implemented logging mechanism using Splunk framework to monitor the interaction between various systems in the Junit application Implemented Junit test cases for all the Web services developed in the application Generated several PDF documents related to order details using iText framework Wrote complex Queries against Informix database to manipulate the order details Complex Queries and logic designed in existing application in Informix 4gl has been implemented using Java J2EE technologies Managed a team size of 20 as a technical lead
