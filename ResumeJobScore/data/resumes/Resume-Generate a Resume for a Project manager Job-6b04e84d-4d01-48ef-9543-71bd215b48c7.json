specialists Front end developers like myself took it upon ourselves to provide accessibility standards based on Section 508 amendment to the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 This typically consisted of things like skip links logical information flow alt tags etc When I started at Alliance Data I was told that I was the sole person responsible for web accessibility I took this very seriously and began researching the current state of web accessibility including WCAG 20 WAIARIA and keyboardonly access I performed a detailed analysis of Alliance Datas conformance with the WCAG 20 standard along
