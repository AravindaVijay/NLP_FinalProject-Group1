modules in AngularJS Created SSIS packages Used SSAS for creating cubes for analysis purposes Created Crystal Reports SSRS reports based on user requirements Coded the application logic layer which contained all the business rules and business entities represented by C Classes It also contained data access logic and data access classes using ADONet which would communicate with the underlying database layer Developed WCF web services for calling API methods Used ADONET to provide connectivity to SQL Server back end database Sessions and View state objects were used to store the state of the user Created and maintained the Admin page for central management of the application Implemented Microsoft ASPNet AJAX Extender Controls like Calendar Tab Control and Update Panel controls to
