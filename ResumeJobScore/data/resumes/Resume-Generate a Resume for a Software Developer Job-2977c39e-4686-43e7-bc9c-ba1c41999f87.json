process to the ES for eligibility determination Only the ES hosts rules defined by the state to determine if the household is eligible for Modified Adjusted Gross Income MAGI Medicaid Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP Advance Premium Tax Credit APTC programs The ES eligibility determination Web service will be invoked by the HIX system in one of multiple available modes and will return response in an XML format which will provide details of the eligibility results for the individuals requesting affordable programs The HIX system will provide the request inquiry Web service that can be invoked by the Eligibility Service to initiate a call from the hix system to request updated eligibility results from the Eligibility Service Responsibilities Involved in Requirements Analysis for
