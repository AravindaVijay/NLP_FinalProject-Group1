void between education and experience that doesnt exist the other way around You can be highly educated and still have little or no experience in a given field But if youre highly experienced in your chosen field not only will you have acquired extensive explicit knowledge but an even higher degree of tacit knowledge which as you may know cannot be attained in a university classroom I have 18 years realworld experience in the web design and development industry during which time I was responsible for taking hundreds of paid client projects from concept to design production and launch and everything else inbetween You cant buy an education that will teach you what I know A company who gets that who recognizes the value of immense acrosstheboard experience thats a company I aspire to
